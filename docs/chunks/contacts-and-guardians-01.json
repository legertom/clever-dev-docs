No custom mappings are supported.\n\n### \n\nSIS-Managed Auto-Sync\n\n[](#sis-managed-auto-sync)\n\n**Limitations**: Contacts field support varies district-to-district.\n\n-   `contact_relationship` is often missing and sometimes you may find `contact_type` containing data you'd typically look for in `contact_relationship`\n-   `phone_type` cannot be set\n-   `contact.sis_id` is supported for Infinite Campus, IC OneRoster API, Skyward, and Skyward API only",
