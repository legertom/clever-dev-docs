  "content": "Clever users, such as teachers, staff, and district admins, can often hold multiple roles within a district. For example, a user might be both a teacher and a school administrator, or a district admin who also teaches a class.\n\nWith API v3.x, user roles are no longer mutually exclusive. Your app must gracefully handle these multi-role scenarios to ensure users have the correct permissions, access, and experience based on their complete role profile.\n\n## \n\nWhy Multi-Role Handling Matters:\n\n[](#why-multi-role-handling-matters)\n\n-   Reflects real-world district structures where users hold overlapping responsibilities.\n-   Avoids blocking users from functionality tied to only one of their roles.\n-   Supports flexible permissions, accurate reporting, and user-friendly UX.\n\n## \n\nUnderstanding the API v3.x User Model\n\n[](#understanding-the-api-v3x-user-model)\n\n-   Users are returned from the `/v3.1/users` or `/v3.1/users/{id}` endpoint.\n-   The user `id` will need to be used in all calls that require a specific user's ID - not the `legacy_id`.\n-   Each user has a `roles` array indicating one or more role types.\n-   Each role includes:\n    -   type (e.g., \"teacher\", \"student\", \"school\\_admin\", \"district\\_admin\")\n    -   Associated `schools` array (for school-scoped roles)\n    -   Role-specific metadata\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Looking to pull users in bulk?\n> \n> Requests made to the `/v3.1/users` endpoint must be authorized with the district-app token and will only return results for Secure Sync apps.\n> \n> If your application only supports District SSO or the Clever Library, you will need to call the `/v3.1/users/{id}` endpoint and authorize with the SSO Bearer access\\_token.\n\n## \n\nMulti-Role users and the `schools` array\n\n[](#multi-role-users-and-the-schools-array)\n\nIn Clever API v3.x, roles like `teacher` and `staff` are scoped to specific schools in the `roles` array. This is clear in the response format from the `/v3.0/users` endpoint, where each `role` can include a `schools` array, indicating which school(s) that role applies to.\n\n_Condensed example record for a user that has the `teacher` and `staff` roles in Clever:_\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"district\": \"6385008f69df036e83e984a3\",\n        \"email\": \"[email protected]\",\n        \"name\": {\n            \"first\": \"Danny\",\n            \"last\": \"Brakus\",\n            \"middle\": \"D\"\n        },\n        \"id\": \"67290af290b55408fa4b09e7\",\n        \"roles\": {\n            \"teacher\": {\n                \"school\": \"63850203bfb8460546071e60\",\n                \"schools\": [\n                    \"63850203bfb8460546071e60\"\n                ],\n                \"sis_id\": \"42\",\n                \"legacy_id\": \"67290af290b55408fa4b09e3\"\n            },\n            \"staff\": {\n                \"roles\": [\n                    \"PortalOnly\"\n                ],\n                \"schools\": [\n                    \"63850203bfb8460546071e5e\"\n                ],\n                \"staff_id\": \"74002\",\n                \"legacy_id\": \"67feda77ecb57b200c573ce6\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThis implies that:\n\n-   A user may be a teacher at one school, but not another.\n-   A user may be an admin (`staff`) at multiple schools, and your app might need to know which school context a given role applies to.\n\n### \n\nExceptions and Considerations\n\n[](#exceptions-and-considerations)\n\n-   This school scoping does not apply to roles like `district_admin`, which are inherently district-wide and don’t list `schools`.\n-   For `students` and `teachers`, the `schools` array specifies all school IDs their **_sections_** are associated with, which by extension associates them with that school site. See this [Help Center article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115003279987?language=en_US) for more information on primary school assignments in Clever.\n-   `students` and `teachers` will have a `school` field, in addition to the `schools` array on their record. If your app requires a primary school association for these users, you should use the `school` field, **not the `schools` array.** See the `teacher` role in the above example for additional context.\n-   `staff` users in Clever cannot have a primary school assigned to them in the same was as a `student` or `teacher` user, and as such, do not have a `school` field under their role - only a `schools` array.\n\n## \n\nImplementation Recommendations\n\n[](#implementation-recommendations)\n\n### \n\n1\\. Always Assume Multiple Roles\n\n[](#1-always-assume-multiple-roles)\n\nUser with a `student` or `contact` role in Clever cannot hold multiple roles. For all other user types, it should be assumed that they have multiple roles, and your application should iterate through all available roles to better understand the user's context.\n\n### \n\n2\\. Choose a Multi-Role Handling Strategy\n\n[](#2-choose-a-multi-role-handling-strategy)\n\nThere are two common approaches to handling multi-role users in your app:\n\n-   **Option 1: Consolidate Roles into One Account**\n    -   Treat all roles as belonging to a single user account.\n    -   Dynamically adjust the user experience based on available roles.\n    -   This option is ideal for apps that support unified views or role-aware permissions.\n-   **Option 2: Role-Specific Accounts**\n    -   Create separate accounts per role.\n    -   Let users switch between roles in your UI (e.g., teacher view vs. admin view).\n    -   Useful if different roles have fundamentally different workflows.\n\n### \n\n3\\. Assigning Permissions and Access\n\n[](#3-assigning-permissions-and-access)\n\nDetermine how roles map to your app's permission system. Consider:\n\n-   Granting permissions based on the most privileged role (e.g., if district admin, full access).\n-   Letting District Admins assign roles manually within your app, based on your use case.\n\n### \n\n4\\. UI Tips for Multi-Role Users\n\n[](#4-ui-tips-for-multi-role-users)\n\n-   Display combined access where applicable (e.g., teacher + admin capabilities).\n-   Or provide a role switcher UI:\n\n> \"You're logged in as a Teacher. Switch to Admin view →\"",
