This typically takes 5 business days but can vary depending on availability.\n4.  **Results and Next Steps**: Receive an email with your certification results and recommended next steps. If needed, we will schedule a call to discuss your integration in greater detail.\n\n* * *\n\n## \n\nHow Do I Get Started?\n\n[](#how-do-i-get-started)\n\n1.  **Create a Development App**: [Sign up](https://apps.clever.com/signup) for a developer account and create a development app in Clever.\n2.  **Submit Application Icon**: During application setup, submit your application icon (square vector file, typically in SVG or AI format).\n3.  **Review Certification Requirements**: Ensure you understand the certification requirements for your integrations.\n4.  **Build Integration**: Read through our API documentation and begin building your integration.\n\n* * *\n\n## \n\nChecklist\n\n[](#checklist)\n\nEnsure the following items are complete before submitting for certification:\n\n-   Visit [Clever Academy](https://clever.academy/) to understand how Clever works.\n-   If you've built an SSO integration, check the [District SSO Checklist and Requirements](/docs/district-sso-certification-guide).
