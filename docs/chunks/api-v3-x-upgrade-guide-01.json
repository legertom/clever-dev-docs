In v3.x and on, Clever will refer to these users as **staff**.\n\n## \n\n4\\. Adjust Event Handling (if applicable)\n\n[](#4-adjust-event-handling-if-applicable)\n\nThe Events API is an optional implementation to sync only data changes via Created, Updated, and Deleted events generated when a connected district makes changes that affect the data shared with your application. If your application uses the Events API on v2.x, you will need to update how your application handles user events for API v3.x.\n\nThe Events API **no longer supports filtering by user type**. For example:\n\n```Text\nGET /v2.0/events?record_type=student\n```\n\n  \n\n```Text\nGET /v3.1/events?record_type=users\n```\n\n> ## 👍\n> \n> **Best Practice:** You’ll need to filter events by user role on your end using the user object returned in each event.\n\nPlease note, the v3.x Events API still adheres to the event ordering used on API v2.x. **Your integration should continue to process events in the order they are received, not by event type.**\n\nFor more information on the Events API, please refer to the [Updating Data with Events page](/docs/events-api).\n\n## \n\n5\\. Accounting for Identity API Changes (SSO)\n\n[](#5-accounting-for-identity-api-changes-sso)\n\nThe type field on /me will now return \"user\" for any user records instead of a specific role type.\n\n### \n\nExample /me response:\n\n[](#example-me-response)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"user\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"id\": \"63850203bfb8460546071e63\",\n        \"district\": \"6385008f69df036e83e984a3\",\n        \"type\": \"user\", // Now always returns \"user\"\n        \"authorized_by\": \"district\"\n    },\n    \"links\": [\n        {\n            \"rel\": \"self\",\n            \"uri\": \"/me\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"rel\": \"canonical\",\n            \"uri\": \"/v3.1/users/63850203bfb8460546071e63\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"rel\": \"district\",\n            \"uri\": \"/v3.1/districts/6385008f69df036e83e984a3\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> **Important:** Do not rely on the type field to provide role information anymore — use the roles array on the user record to better understand the user's context.\n\n## \n\n6\\. Plan for Multi-Role Users\n\n[](#6-plan-for-multi-role-users)\n\nAs district needs have evolved rapidly over time, many users now have multiple roles (e.g., both a teacher and staff). Your app should be able to gracefully handle this use case.\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> For more detailed information on handling multi-role users, please refer to the [Multi-Role Users in Clever](/docs/multi-role-users-in-clever) doc.\n\n### \n\nOption 1: Consolidate roles into one app account\n\n[](#option-1-consolidate-roles-into-one-app-account)\n\n-   One account per user, regardless of role\n\n### \n\nOption 2: Role-specific accounts\n\n[](#option-2-role-specific-accounts)\n\n-   Treat each role as a separate account\n-   Allow the user to easily switch between the two account roles in your app via UI\n\n### \n\nPermissions and Access\n\n[](#permissions-and-access)\n\nYou'll also need to consider how these multi-role users will be granted access to specific functions of your application, depending on your use case. For example, you could assign permissions based on highest role available from Clever, or allow District Admins to manually assign elevated permissions in your app.\n\n## \n\n7\\. Testing with sandbox data\n\n[](#7-testing-with-sandbox-data)\n\nOnce you've completed the above changes, we recommend using your existing sandbox district and Clever dev application to test your app's capabilities using API v3.x. If you're using the Events API, we recommend connecting with the #DEMO Certification ISD - Events sandbox district, which automatically rotates through a 3-day data set. If your dev app is not already connected, please contact [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0861667c6d6f7a697c6167667b486b646d7e6d7a266b6765) to have your dev app connected to #DEMO Certification ISD - Events.",
