  "content": "# \n\nWorking with Clever's REST API\n\n[](#working-with-clevers-rest-api)\n\nIt's easy to work with Clever's REST API and authentication routines without needing specialized libraries. If you can issue and receive HTTP requests and process JSON response bodies, you have everything you need for a Clever integration.\n\n## \n\nOAuth 2.0 Libraries\n\n[](#oauth-20-libraries)\n\nYou don't really need a client library for OAuth 2.0 – the flows boil down to simple HTTP. If you have an HTTP interface in your programming language of choice, you already have an OAuth 2.0 client. OAuth 2.0 isn't just \"one thing\" — it's a collection of approaches for service providers (like Clever) and client applications (like yours) to authorize users and authenticate requests. Often OAuth 2.0 libraries serve both audiences simultaneously, leaving you with a heavy-duty library better suited for service providers when you just want to do some basic HTTP.\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> When evaluating OAuth 2.0 libraries, make sure you're not working with an OAuth 1.0A library -- Clever does not support the more complicated OAuth 1.0A authentication.\n\n## \n\nClever API Libraries\n\n[](#clever-api-libraries)\n\nClever does not maintain any libraries, but if you would like to generate your own using the swagger file, it is available at [https://github.com/Clever/swagger-api](https://github.com/Clever/swagger-api).\n\nClever offers a few community-supported libraries that wrap REST API access with object interfaces. While these libraries won't necessarily help you obtain access tokens, they do make it easier for you to retrieve and operate on Clever data once you've obtained them.\n\n**Community Supported:**\n\n-   [clever-php](https://github.com/Clever/clever-php/)\n-   [clever-java](https://github.com/Clever/clever-java)\n-   [clever-ruby](https://github.com/Clever/clever-ruby)\n-   [clever-csharp](https://github.com/Clever/clever-csharp)\n-   [clever-python](https://github.com/Clever/clever-python)\n-   [clever-go](https://github.com/Clever/clever-go)\n-   [clever-js](https://github.com/Clever/clever-js)\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Community-supported libraries are not actively maintained by Clever, although we do review and merge incoming pull requests.\n\n## \n\nClever iOS SDK\n\n[](#clever-ios-sdk)\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> The Clever iOS SDK has been deprecated\n> \n> If you are looking to implement Clever SSO with your native iOS application, please see our updated documentation here: [https://dev.clever.com/docs/ios](/docs/ios)",
