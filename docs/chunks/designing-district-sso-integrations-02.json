  "content": "Districts can choose to add usernames to the data in Clever, though in order for us to be able to sync this information, it must be stored in the SIS (or provided in the SFTP files). In our API, this is the `credentials.district_username` field.\n\nYou might choose to let them set usernames initially via the Clever feed, but then ignore any updates to usernames. This will allow you to preserve credentials even if a district omits them from the feed.\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> The username field in Clever is shared across applications. If a district's usernames do not meet your requirements, they may not be able to change them. For this reason, you should have a [backup](https://cybernews.com/resources/web-hosting-glossary/#backup) method of setting usernames.\n\nClever does not guarantee uniqueness of the district\\_username field provided through the API. The API passes through the values that the district provides. Username conflicts should be identified in your application, and the district must resolve conflicts by changing the information that they're sending through Clever.\n\nClever recommends that you do not require unique usernames across your entire product. Because districts often use usernames such as firstinitiallastname, it is common to find conflicting usernames in different districts. Requiring uniqueness across the product will lead to frustration for districts that have existing username conventions that collide with those of other districts. Districts should be able to comply with providing usernames that are unique within a school or within a district.\n\n## \n\nError handling\n\n[](#error-handling)\n\nIf an error happens during login, you should display a human-friendly error message and encourage the user to log in again.\n\n## \n\nLogout\n\n[](#logout)\n\nWhen a user logs out of your application, the window should close or they should be taken to your login screen. Ideally, your login screen should have a Log in with Clever button.\n\nYou **must not** attempt to log the user out of Clever.\n\n## \n\nUsers with multiple roles\n\n[](#users-with-multiple-roles)\n\nIt's possible for a teacher to also be a school or district administrator in Clever, but these accounts all have distinct Clever IDs. When logging in through Instant Login, we ask the user to choose which account they are logging in to. On your side, you can handle this one of two ways:\n\n-   Create separate accounts for each user type - users can only access admin functionality when logged in as an administrator account\n-   Create one user with elevated permissions - you can often merge these accounts based on email address. The user you create should then be associated with multiple Clever IDs so that the user gets the same account regardless of which user type they selected when they logged in to Clever.\n\n## \n\nInstant Login on Mobile Devices\n\n[](#instant-login-on-mobile-devices)\n\nInstant Login works in browsers on any device. In the browser, we will redirect the user to your primary redirect URL exactly as we do on a non-mobile device.\n\nWe've also created our own iOS app, which allows users to log in to Clever and your app using any identity provider, including Clever Badges. For more information, see [SSO on iOS/iPadOS](/docs/ios).\n\n## \n\nInstant Login with Multi-Tenant Setups\n\n[](#instant-login-with-multi-tenant-setups)\n\nIf you have a separate subdomain for each district or school, you can use a Login with Clever link to specify which redirect URL to send a user to when they log in using that button. However, if a user logs in through the Clever Portal or an Instant Login link, they'll be sent to your primary redirect URL. In order for users to successfully log in through every login path, your primary redirect URL needs to be prepared to log the user in to the correct site after the OAuth flow is complete - we call this an 'OAuth handler.'\n\nEach user has two fields that will make this much easier: `id` and `district`. If your tenants are segmented by districts, you can simply find which subdomain is associated with that district's ID. Alternatively, you can look up the user's ID in your database and see which tenant they are associated with.",
