  "content": "> ## 🚧\n> \n> Note the difference between `user_id` and `multi_role_user_id`. Also note that `multi_role_user_id` matches `sub`.\n\n  \n\n[Secure Sync](/docs/district-getting-started) allows you to access the entirety of the Data API, our matchmaking tools, and more.\n\n  \n\n## \n\nOAuth Flow\n\n[](#oauth-flow)\n\n  \n\nThe expected implementation of SSO with Clever is the authorization code grant type. The step-by-step flow is detailed below:\n\n  \n\n1.  A user initiates a login (see [Initiating Logins](/docs/oauth-implementation#initiating-logins))\n2.  If the user is already authenticated with Clever, Clever will redirect the user to your application’s **redirect URI** with an **authorization code** appended. If the user is not yet authenticated with Clever, they will be asked to provide their Clever credentials before being redirected.\n3.  Your application will POST the **authorization code** back to Clever’s token endpoint with the appropriate credentials. See [our Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/developer-collections/request/iouuo4x/auth-grant-flow-tokens) for an example.\n    1.  You can also test it out from your terminal using our guide [here](/docs/getting-started-with-clever-sso).\n4.  Clever responds with an **access token** in order to provide your application access to the end-user’s **protected resource**.\n5.  The **access token** can then be used at [https://api.clever.com/v3.0/me](https://api.clever.com/v3.0/me) to grab the **resource owner’s** Clever ID.\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> /me Endpoint Version\n> \n> Be sure to specify a version in your /me endpoint call. This will ensure you receive the correct Clever ID for a user given the API version being used in other API calls.\n\n6.  Using the **access token** and the **resource owner’s Clever ID**, your application can then make a call to [https://api.clever.com/v3.0/users/{id}](https://api.clever.com/v3.0/users/%7Bid%7D) to access additional information that can be used to authenticate a user. See [our Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/developer-collections/request/gbicgr1/users-id) for an example.\n\n  \n\n## \n\nOIDC Flow\n\n[](#oidc-flow)\n\n  \n\nThe OIDC flow is similar to the basic OAuth 2.0 flow, but is better suited for authentication and is meant to be more secure.\n\n  \n\nClever's OIDC **discovery endpoint** can be found here: [<https://clever.com/.well-known/openid-configuration>](https://clever.com/.well-known/openid-configuration)\n\n  \n\nThe flow is described below:\n\n  \n\n1.  A user initiates a login (see [Initiating Logins](/docs/oauth-implementation#initiating-logins))\n2.  If the user is already authenticated with Clever, Clever will redirect the user to your application’s **redirect URI** with an **authorization code** appended. If the user is not yet authenticated with Clever, they will be asked to provide their Clever credentials before being redirected.\n3.  Your application will POST the **authorization code** back to Clever’s token endpoint with the appropriate credentials. See ([our Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/developer-collections/request/iouuo4x/auth-grant-flow-tokens)) for an example.\n4.  Clever responds with an **identity token** that can be decoded and used to identify the resource owner (See [OAuth/OIDC Data Access](/docs/overview#oauthoidc-data-access) above).\n\n  \n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> At this time, the ID token is not available for **Library integrations**. However, you can also use the **userinfo endpoint** mentioned below\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> It's worth noting that the **access token** can also be used at the **userinfo endpoint**: <https://api.clever.com/userinfo>. This is also considered a part of the OIDC specification.",
