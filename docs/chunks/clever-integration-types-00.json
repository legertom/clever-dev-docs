  "content": "## \n\nClever Integration Options\n\n[](#clever-integration-options)\n\nThe following are the different integration types you can build with Clever:\n\n**Rostering (Secure Sync)**\n\n-   Secure Sync delivers comprehensive roster data, including student demographics and enrollment information, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records as changes are received from the district SIS. By providing structured user and role data, it simplifies integration for downstream systems, helping organizations manage access, personalize experiences, and maintain data consistency. For Secure Sync access, reach out to [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0869787864616b697c6167662561667c6d7a6d7b7c486b646d7e6d7a266b6765).\n-   Managed by district administrators.\n-   Your application can be added through the _Request Application_ page on the district dashboard. To learn more, see [Getting Started in the District](/docs/district-getting-started).\n\n**LMS Connect**\n\n-   Managed by district administrators. This integration type **requires a Secure Sync subscription**.\n-   Districts can request to connect to your application via LMS Connect. This integration enhances your Secure Sync integration and **allows assignment and grade passback** with the most popular K12 LMSs.  \n    To learn more, see [LMS Connect - Overview](/docs/lms-connect-overview).\n\n**District Single Sign-On (SSO)**\n\n-   Managed by district administrators.\n-   Your application can be added through the _Request Application_ page on the district dashboard. This integration allows district administrators to scope SSO access to any Clever user within their district.  \n    To learn more, see [District SSO](/docs/district-sso).\n\n**Clever Library SSO and Rostering**\n\n-   Managed by teachers.\n-   Teachers can add your application through the [Clever Library](https://clever.com/library) and provision accounts for themselves and their students on-demand.  \n    To learn more, see [Library SSO + Classroom Rostering](/docs/library-sso).\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> **Development App Scopes**\n> \n> By default, your Clever development app will include **Library (Classroom)** and **District SSO** scopes. To request **Rostering** and **LMS Connect** scopes, contact [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#432233332f2a2022372a2c2d6e2a2d37263126303703202f263526316d202c2e).\n\n* * *\n\n## \n\nDistrict vs Library (Classroom) Integrations\n\n[](#district-vs-library-classroom-integrations)\n\n### \n\nDistrict Integration Experience\n\n[](#district-integration-experience)\n\nDistrict administrators can search for and add your application in the district dashboard, granting access to all users within the district. Once a district shares data, all users within the district who are scoped for access can have their data available via the district-app token, enabling you to manage rostering and account provisioning at scale.\n\n### \n\nDistrict SSO User Login Methods\n\n[](#district-sso-user-login-methods)\n\n1.  **Clever Portal**  \n    A central point for many districts to access their applications.\n    \n2.  **Instant Login Links**  \n    Use embedded links to log users directly into your app through Instant Login.\n    \n3.  **Log In with Clever**  \n    Embed a \"Log in with Clever\" button on your website for direct user authentication.\n    \n\n### \n\nData Shared via District SSO\n\n[](#data-shared-via-district-sso)\n\n-   Clever ID (unique and stable ID created by Clever)\n-   Full Name (first, last)\n-   Email Address\n-   District\n\n### \n\nData Shared via Secure Sync\n\n[](#data-shared-via-secure-sync)\n\nWhile **District SSO** only provides name, email address, and Clever ID for a user, **Secure Sync** provides full access to roster information, including student-teacher associations and classroom-level data. OAuth tokens can be retrieved from your App Dashboard or via [Clever API](/docs/exploring-the-clever-api). A Secure Sync subscription grants access to the entire Data API, as well as a suite of developer tooling that comes in handy for managing your district connections. For the full list of available fields, see our [schema](https://clever.com/schema).\n\n### \n\nData Shared via LMS Connect\n\n[](#data-shared-via-lms-connect)\n\nThe LMS Connect integration extends your existing rostering and enrollment data to provide LTI capabilities such as grade passback and LTI SSO. With this integration, you can create assignments and submit grades directly to a district’s LMS. You can also track updates to the assignments and submissions made through LMS Connect, but you won’t have access to assignments or submissions created outside of this integration.\"\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> **Available Fields**\n> \n> For a detailed list of fields available for each integration type, check the [Clever API Schema](https://clever.com/schema).\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> **Working with Districts**\n> \n> Learn how applications connect with districts:\n> \n> -   [For District Admins: Add or Remove Apps](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/203114997?language=en_US)\n> -   [For App Partners: Inviting & Connecting Districts to Your App](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/215120718?language=en_US)\n\n* * *\n\n### \n\nLibrary (Classroom) Integration Experience\n\n[](#library-classroom-integration-experience)\n\nWhen a teacher selects a new app from the Clever Library or clicks \"Sign Up with Clever,\" they are presented with a consent screen to authorize Clever to share their class data with your app. After consent, Clever redirects the teacher to your app, where you facilitate the OAuth Single Sign-On flow to query user identity and classroom information. The teacher's account is provisioned immediately, and their section and student data is populated, providing a seamless login experience. The app will also be available in the [Clever Portal](https://clever.com/products/sso) for the teacher and their students.\n\n### \n\nTeacher Sign-Up Entry Points\n\n[](#teacher-sign-up-entry-points)",
