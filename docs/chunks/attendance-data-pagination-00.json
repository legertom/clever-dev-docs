  "content": "The Attendance API uses **cursor-based pagination** to allow apps to fetch large sets of attendance records efficiently and reliably. This approach ensures consistent traversal of results, even as new data is added to the system.\n\n* * *\n\n### \n\nHow Pagination Works\n\n[](#how-pagination-works)\n\nRecords are returned in a stable order based on the composite sort key:\n\n```\n(date, student_id, section_id, school_id) //student_id, section_id, and school_id are Clever-generated identifiers.\n```\n\nIf the response includes more records than can fit on one page, it will contain a starting\\_after token referencing the last record returned. Use this token in the next request to retrieve the following page.\n\n```http\nGET /v3.1/attendance/schools/{school_id}?\n  date_range_start=2025-04-01&date_range_end=2025-04-01&limit=100&starting_after=MjAyNS0wNC0wMV82N2Y0MjE2OTJlZGEwZTNmYTE4ODBlNTNfNjdmNDIxNjkyZWRhMGUzZmExODgwZThkXzY3ZjQyMTY5MmVkYTBlM2ZhMTg4MGU0Zg==\n```\n\n* * *\n\n### \n\nWhat the Cursor Represents\n\n[](#what-the-cursor-represents)\n\nThe `starting_after` cursor is a **base64-encoded string** representing a composite key made up of:\n\n-   `date`\n-   `student_id` (Clever ID)\n-   `section_id` (Clever ID)\n-   `school_id` (Clever ID)\n\nWhen decoded, a cursor might look like:\n\n```text\n2025-04-01_67f421692eda0e3fa1880e53_67f421692eda0e3fa1880e8d_67f421692eda0e3fa1880e4f\n```\n\nIf one or more fields are missing for a given record (e.g., a section or student ID), that position is filled with a **zero-padded placeholder** matching the length of a standard ID (24 characters):\n\n```text\n2025-04-01_67f421692eda0e3fa1880e53_000000000000000000000000_67f421692eda0e3fa1880e4f\n```\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> You do not need to decode cursors params\n> \n> Simply pass the `starting_after` token from one response into the next request to paginate through results.\n\n* * *\n\n### \n\nWhy Base64 Encoding?\n\n[](#why-base64-encoding)\n\nWe encode cursors in base64 to:\n\n-   Represent composite keys in a compact, consistent format\n-   Allow future schema flexibility without breaking existing integrations\n\nWhile the cursor can technically be decoded, **it is intentionally designed to be treated as an opaque value.**\n\n* * *\n\n### \n\nRecord Uniqueness\n\n[](#record-uniqueness)\n\nAttendance records are uniquely identified by the combination of:\n\n-   `date`\n-   `student_id`\n-   `section_id`\n-   `school_id`\n\nOnly one record is expected per unique combination per day. If a record with the same key appears again, it should be interpreted as an **incremental update or overwrite** of the existing record.",
