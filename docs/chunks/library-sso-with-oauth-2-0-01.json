  "content": "Clever accepts POSTs to oauth/tokens using both traditional web POST bodies of the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` variety in addition to `application/json`. Make sure to always tell Clever what kind of content you're sending with an explicit Content-Type HTTP header.\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> Other POST body types, including `multipart/form-data`, are not accepted. If you receive 'invalid request / invalid content-type' error messages, make sure you're using either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json`\n\nEnsure that you're properly escaping values in your POST bodies. In either approach, use UTF-8 characters. Proper URL-encoding is required for application/x-www-form-urlencoded requests.\n\nHTTP libraries typically will take care of computing your Content-Length header — it is also required for POST requests.\n\nThe body of the request must have the following parameters:\n\n**Parameter**\n\n**Example**\n\n**Description**\n\n`code`\n\n`heRte321`\n\nThe exchange code received on your redirect URI\n\n`grant_type`\n\n`authorization_code`\n\nThe type of exchange; always `authorization_code` in this sequence\n\n`redirect_uri`\n\n`https://flightschool.edu/oauth`\n\nThe _exact_ redirect URI at which the `code` was received\n\nHere's what a POST looks like using `application/x-www-form-urlencode` - note that the redirect URI is properly URL encoded:\n\n```\nPOST https://clever.com/oauth/tokens\nAuthorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET>\nContent-type: application/x-www-form-url-encoded\ncode=heRte321&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fflightschool.edu%2Foauth\n```\n\nAnd here it is with `application/json`\n\n```\nPOST https://clever.com/oauth/tokens\nAuthorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET>\nContent-type: application/json\n{\"code\":\"heRte321\",\"grant_type\":\"authorization_code\",\"redirect_uri\":\"https://flightschool.edu/oauth\"}\n```\n\n### \n\nAcquiring the Token\n\n[](#acquiring-the-token)\n\nClever will respond with a token as long as:\n\n-   `client_id` and `client_secret` are valid\n-   `redirect_uri` matches where Clever sent the code\n-   `code` is valid\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Codes are valid for one minute, and may only be exchanged once.\n\nThe response looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP 200 OK\nContent-type: application/json\n{\"access_token\":\"jsfUI2131da2f\"}\n```\n\nAfter you consume this JSON response and take hold of this access token value in whichever way is appropriate for your environment, you'll want to use it to determine more information about its owner.\n\nStore the token in a temporary location — in the next step, we'll receive their unique Clever ID and figure out whether it belongs to a student or teacher. Once we have that information, we'll want to store this access token in a secure place and use it whenever we're making requests on behalf of that user.\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> Tokens expire after 24 hours and cannot be refreshed - do not store the token for long-term user identification. User sessions expire after 2 hours.\n\n## \n\nUsing the Token\n\n[](#using-the-token)\n\nOnce the token is acquired, you should that token to GET the `https://api.clever.com/v3.0/me` endpoint - this endpoint should return the user's Clever `id`, `district` ID, and the token `type`\n\nTypically, once you've obtained the access token you will want to immediately determine its owner. Access tokens obtained through Clever SSO grant access to a subset of Clever's Data API.\n\nIn this section we will discover the identity of our mysterious user by using the access token we received in the previous step to issue a request to api.clever.com/v3.0/me.\n\n## \n\nUsing bearer tokens\n\n[](#using-bearer-tokens)\n\nYou now have an access token. It is yours to bear. Your application is the bearer of that access token. It is now your bearer token and it symbolizes the relationship between the user and your application.\n\nBearer tokens are easily used with any HTTP library that allows you to manually specify an HTTP Authorization header.\n\nYour Authorization header value will be a string containing the word Bearer followed by a space character and then the access token value you received after exchanging your code.\n\nIf we were to issue a request using the bearer token we received in the last step, jsfUI2131da2f, our authorization header would look something like:\n\n```\nGET https://api.clever.com/some_clever_resource\nAuthorization: Bearer jsfUI2131da2f\n```",
