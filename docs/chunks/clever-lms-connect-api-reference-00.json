  "content": "> ## 🚧\n> \n> v3.1 Only\n> \n> LMS Connect API endpoints are only available on v3.1 of the Clever API. If you are interested in getting started with LMS Connect, reach out to [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d6c7d7d61646e6c7964626320646379687f687e794d6e61687b687f236e6260).\n\n## \n\nAPI Reference\n\n[](#api-reference)\n\n### \n\nAuthentication\n\n[](#authentication)\n\nAuthentication for the grade passback API uses the same district-app token as a rostering connection. This token should be passed as a Bearer token in the header of the request.\n\n### \n\nPagination\n\n[](#pagination)\n\nPagination for the grade passback API works slightly differently than in the data API. For requests that return more than one page of results, a “next” link will be provided, but there will not be a “previous” link. **This relative link is only valid for two hours after the original request is made.**\n\n### \n\nRate limits\n\n[](#rate-limits)\n\nThe Grade Passback API has the [same rate limits as the Clever data API](/docs/error-messages#rate-limiting) , 1200 requests per minute per Bearer token. Note that some requests, especially those for creating and updating assignments or submissions, may take longer than requests to the data API, so make sure not to set request timeouts too short (we recommend between 15 and 60 seconds).\n\n### \n\nLMS-specific fields\n\n[](#lms-specific-fields)\n\nAll of the fields below can be queried on the /districts/{id} endpoint.\n\n-   We have an **lms\\_state** field to indicate if the LMS connection has been activated and if users have been matched (which is required for grade and assignment writeback).\n-   For Users, Sections, and Events, API calls can now return a **lms\\_status** object with **synced\\_in\\_lms** set to **true** if that entity has been synced with Clever LMS Connect. This can be used for troubleshooting, and is particularly useful for Sections since their sync status can be verified before instead of making multiple assignment calls and then waiting for errors to show up.\n-   We also include a **last\\_lms\\_sync** field to indicate a timestamp of when Clever last received data from the LMS.\n-   Our **lms\\_matched\\_percentage** field displays a percentage breakdown of matched students, teachers, and sections. This replaces the slow, inefficient need to query all users/sections to calculate match rates.\n\nIf you'd like to use these fields in your implementation, please submit a request via our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com) to have them enabled.\n\n### \n\nEndpoints\n\n[](#endpoints)\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Want to test out the LMS Connect API?\n> \n> Be sure to check out our [Beginner's Guide](/docs/lms-connect-beginners-guide) and [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/developer-collections/collection/3kyuivw/lms-connect-v3-1).\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Save your assignment IDs!\n> \n> There is currently no way for you to call the API for a list of your existing assignment IDs. Once an assignment has been created and an **assignment ID** has been generated, you will need to save each assignment ID you generate in your own database so that you can make adjustments to the assignments later. Failure to do this will result in an inability to access previously created assignments in the API. If this happens, please reach out to [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f69f988293918497829f999885b6959a93809384d895999b)\n\n  \n\n**Name**\n\n**Endpoint**\n\n**Description**\n\n**Path Params (required)**\n\n**Query Params**\n\n**Request Body (required fields in bold)**\n\n**Additional notes**\n\nDistrict LMS status\n\n`GET https://api.clever.com/v3.1/districts/<district_id>`\n\nIncludes LMS integration information in District object\n\ndistrict\\_id (string, ObjectID)\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\nAllowed values for lms\\_state: \\[\"success\", \"matching\\_in\\_progress\", \"disconnected\", \"error\",\"\"\\]\n\nCreate Assignment\n\n`POST https://api.clever.com/v3.1/sections/<section_id>/assignments`\n\nCreates a new assignment in the specified section\n\nsection\\_id (string, ObjectID)\n\n\\-\n\n**title (string)**,  \n**description (string)**,  \nattachments (List of attachments),  \n**due\\_date (Date)**,  \nassignee\\_mode (string), assignee\\_ids (string\\[\\], ObjectIDs),  \npoints\\_possible (number),  \nsubmission\\_types (string\\[\\]), max\\_attempts (number),  \nterm\\_id (string, ObjectID)\n\nAllowed values for assignee\\_mode: \\[\"all\", \"individuals\"\\]  \n  \n\"all\" is recommended for most use cases  \n  \nassignee\\_ids only required for assignee\\_mode \"individuals\"  \n  \nAllowed values for submission\\_types:  \n\\[\"link\", \"text\"\\]\n\nGet Assignment\n\n`GET https://api.clever.com/v3.1/sections/<section_id>/assignments/<assignment_id>`\n\nReturns a specific assignment for a section\n\nsection\\_id (string, ObjectID),  \nassignment\\_id (string, UUID)\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\nUpdate Assignment\n\n`PATCH https://api.clever.com/v3.1/sections/<section_id>/assignments/<assignment_id>`\n\nUpdates an existing assignment in the specified section\n\nsection\\_id (string, ObjectID), assignment\\_id (string, UUID)\n\n–\n\n**One or more of:**  \ntitle (string),  \ndescription (string),  \nattachments (List of attachments),  \ndue\\_date (Date),  \nassignee\\_ids (string\\[\\], ObjectIDs),  \npoints\\_possible (number),  \nsubmission\\_types (string\\[\\]), max\\_attempts (number),  \nterm\\_id (string, ObjectID)\n\nDelete Assignment\n\n`DELETE https://api.clever.com/v3.1/sections/<section_id>/assignments/<assignment_id>`\n\nDeletes an existing assignment in the specified section\n\nsection\\_id (string, ObjectID), assignment\\_id (string, UUID)\n\n–\n\n–\n\nUpon deletion success, the Clever API will respond with HTTP code 200, and an empty response.\n\nView Submissions\n\n`GET https://api.clever.com/v3.1/sections/<section_id>/assignments/<assignment_id>/submissions`\n\nReturns the submissions for an assignment\n\nsection\\_id (string, ObjectID), assignment\\_id (string, UUID)\n\nlimit, starting\\_after, ending\\_before\n\n–\n\nGet Submission\n\n`GET https://api.clever.com/v3.1/sections/<section_id>/assignments/<assignment_id>/submissions/<user_id>`\n\nReturns a specific user's submission for an assignment",
