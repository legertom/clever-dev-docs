There are two prerequisites that will need to be met before continuing:\n\n  \n\n-   You have access to a Clever Developer Application.\n    -   To follow this tutorial, we recommend using a Clever dev app that you have access to and can freely modify. To create a new dev app for free, please navigate to [https://apps.clever.com/signup](https://apps.clever.com/signup).\n-   You have access to Postman.\n    -   Postman is a third-party software used for building and using APIs. To get started with Postman, see this link for download options: [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)\n\n  \n\n## \n\nSetting an accessible Redirect URI\n\n[](#setting-an-accessible-redirect-uri)\n\n  \n\nIn the Dev account of your choice, log into the Application Dashboard and navigate to Settings > Instant Login and update the OAuth Settings so the first Redirect URI listed is https://localhost:3000. This sets the Redirect URI to be your local machine. Clever will always use the first Redirect URI listed by default. Once the Redirect URI has been populated, select Save.\n\n  \n\n![1491](https://files.readme.io/be464b2-oauth_tutorial_1.png \"oauth_tutorial_1.png\")\n\nScreenshot of dashboard OAuth settings\n\n  \n\n![503](https://files.readme.io/1817a1b-oauth_tutorial_2.png \"oauth_tutorial_2.png\")\n\nScreenshot of redirect URI settings\n\n  \n\n## \n\nSetting up the query in Postman\n\n[](#setting-up-the-query-in-postman)\n\n  \n\nThe next few steps involve querying the Clever API in order to obtain the authorization code from Clever, and subsequently, the Bearer Token. **The authorization code is only valid for a minute once it's been provided on the API**, so before moving forward, let's go ahead and set up the query we need to run in Postman to save time.\n\nIn Postman, you'll want to create a new POST query, then set the URL as [https://clever.com/oauth/tokens](https://clever.com/oauth/tokens):\n\n![1348](https://files.readme.io/8ae4335-oauth_tutorial_3.png \"oauth_tutorial_3.png\")\n\nScreenshot of /tokens POST in Postman\n\n  \n\nNext, navigate to the Body tab underneath the URL and input the following info:\n\n  \n\nKEY\n\nVALUE\n\ncode\n\ngrant\\_type\n\nauthorization\\_code\n\nredirect\\_uri\n\nhttps://localhost:3000\n\n  \n\nIn the table, you'll notice that the value for code is blank. We still need to pull the code for this query, but since the Authorization Code is only active for a minute, it's wise to set all of this up before-hand.\n\n  \n\nYou'll also need to provide your Dev app's Client ID and Client Secret under the Authorization tab in Postman. For Type, you'll want to select the Basic Auth option, then paste the Client ID and Client Secret into the Username and Password fields, respectively:\n\n  \n\n![1297](https://files.readme.io/999cb24-oauth_tutorial_4.png \"oauth_tutorial_4.png\")\n\nScreenshot of Postman authorization setting\n\n  \n\n## \n\nObtaining the Authorization Code\n\n[](#obtaining-the-authorization-code)\n\nNext, copy this Log in With Clever (LIWC) sample URL: [https://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response\\_type=code&redirect\\_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&client\\_id=YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_ID](https://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID). This link can also be found on this page in our dev docs, in case you need to reference this info in the future.  \nWith the LIWC URL in hand, navigate to your browser of choice and paste the link, but don't hit enter. First, go back to Hall Monitor and copy your dev app's Client ID from the Info page. You'll then paste the Client ID to replace YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_ID in the URL:\n\n  \n\n![1219](https://files.readme.io/02a0b4d-oauth_tutorial_6.png \"oauth_tutorial_6.png\")\n\nLIWC sample URL client ID param\n\n  \n\nYou'll then need to populate the redirect\\_uri here:\n\n![1223](https://files.readme.io/5973eb4-oauth_tutorial_7.png \"oauth_tutorial_7.png\")\n\nLIWC sample URL redirect URI param\n\n  \n\nWith the https://localhost:3000 populated, this is what the URL should look like:\n\n  \n\n![1220](https://files.readme.io/18440d0-oauth_tutorial_8.png \"oauth_tutorial_8.png\")\n\nLIWC sample URL\n\n  \n\nOnce the URL is complete, copy the URL and open a new tab in your browser, then paste the Authorization Code into the URL bar. It should bring you to a page where you need to login to Clever. You can use your demo district with the demo Clever USD data set and login using a sample student.\n\n  \n\nTIPS:\n\n-   For a quick user, try using this student number: 243615677.\n-   You can also paste the district id in the school-picker for your demo district to quickly get to the login page.  \n    After attempting to login to Clever, you should see this error page:\n\n  \n\n![1716](https://files.readme.io/7e5d84a-9.png \"9.png\")\n\nScreenshot of authorization step in OAuth flow\n\n  \n\nYou can find the Authorization Code here in the URL:\n\n  \n\n![1230](https://files.readme.io/cc04208-oauth_tutorial_10.png \"oauth_tutorial_10.png\")\n\nAuthorization code in URL\n\n  \n\n## \n\nObtaining the Bearer Token\n\n[](#obtaining-the-bearer-token)\n\n  \n\nThe next step is to paste the code into Postman and query the Clever Identity API to obtain the Bearer Token - in the next 60 seconds!  \nYou'll need to paste the Authorization Code in the Value field for code, then click Send:\n\n  \n\n![1307](https://files.readme.io/dcf9005-oauth_tutorial_11.png \"oauth_tutorial_11.png\")\n\nScreenshot of authorization code in Postman\n\n  \n\n## \n\nUsing the access\\_token for other API Endpoints\n\n[](#using-the-access_token-for-other-api-endpoints)\n\n  \n\nUpon a successful query, you should see the access\\_token. You may also see an id\\_token if your dev app is configured to use OpenID Connect (OIDC).\n\n  ",
