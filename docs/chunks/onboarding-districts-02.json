  "content": "1.  A district authorizes your application through Clever and shares some records.\n2.  You upload a CSV with your existing student, teacher, admin, school, or section/enrollment records.\n3.  Matchmaker matches the records you uploaded with the records shared with your application in Clever.\n4.  Clever emails you a CSV with a list of matched records and a list of unmatched records.\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Our robots aren't perfect :(\n> \n> Matchmaker does its best to match all of your records, but sometimes it just can't match every single one perfectly. We always recommend checking over your Matchmaker results before processing them and making manual matches when necessary.\n> \n> Matchmaker does not play nicely with our sample data sets as there will often be many users who have the same name, increasing the chances of false negatives in the data.\n\n### \n\nInput CSV Guidelines\n\n[](#input-csv-guidelines)\n\nWhen creating an input CSV to upload to Matchmaker, follow these guidelines to help Matchmaker produce accurate matches. Use [this example CSV](https://assets.clever.com/example-data/matchmaker_input_example.csv) as a guide. Note: you can use any fields in your CSV as long as your file meets the following requirements:\n\n-   It must be a valid CSV file (in accordance with RFC 4180). Specifically:\n    -   Every row should have the same number of columns, separated by commas.\n    -   Any values with commas in them should be surrounded by a matching set of quotes.\n-   It must contain a column header for each field.\n-   It should contain as many fields as possible. The more information you provide about each record, the better chance it will have of being matched.\n-   It must contain a unique internal identifier for each record. Use this identifier to associate matched records with the original accounts in your application.\n-   It should contain exactly one record for each user. If a user has multiple accounts in your application, please choose one to match with Clever. Duplicate records will not be matched.\n\n### \n\nOutput CSV Format\n\n[](#output-csv-format)\n\nMatchmaker outputs a CSV containing all of the fields from your input CSV, including additional identifying fields from Clever.\n\n-   Column headers for your input fields will begin with `app`. (e.g., `app.email`).\n-   Column headers for Clever fields will begin with `clever`. (e.g., `clever.id`).\n-   The `matchmaker_results` column will contain a string indicating whether the record was matched. There are five possible values for this column:\n    -   `match` - the record was matched.\n    -   `from app, no match` - the record from your application could not be matched to any record in Clever.\n    -   `from app, duplicate` - the record from your application was a duplicate with another record in your application. To match these records, we recommend that you pick one record to serve as the representative for all groups of duplicate records, remove the rest, and re-run matchmaker.\n    -   `from Clever, no match` - the record in Clever could not be matched to any record from your application.\n    -   `from Clever, duplicate` - the record from Clever was a duplicate with another record from Clever. To match these records, you may need to work with the district and Clever Support to clean up their data.\n\nOnce you receive your matching output, you can associate the matched records in your application with the corresponding Clever ID (found in the `clever.id` column).\n\n### \n\nPrivacy\n\n[](#privacy)\n\nMatchmaker will only match app records against district records that have been shared with the app in Clever. Matchmaker input and output CSVs are purged from Clever's system 30 days after upload.",
