  "content": "> ## 📘\n> \n> Important\n> \n> Even though your dev app comes with a pre-populated, pre-created sandbox district, it’s important that you test with a demo teacher from a district in Clever that is **_not connected at the district level_** to your development app. This will provide a representative test of a signup experience from a Clever teacher who is not currently shared by a school or district.\n> \n> Also, note that school and district administrators **do not have permissions** to log in to your application via Clever Library, as a teacher is limited to only sharing his/her classroom data. Administrators must be shared at the district level to access an application.\n\n## \n\nTesting with your Clever Dashboard's Integration Guide\n\n[](#testing-with-your-clever-dashboards-integration-guide)\n\nYou can test a single teacher and student flow with the Integration Guide located in your Clever Dashboard.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/54ad55b-Library_Integration_Guide.png \"Library Integration Guide.png\")\n\nNavigate to the section titled \"Fetch data via the Clever API\" and select the user type you would like to test with. This will simulate a login with by directing a user connected to our internally managed sandbox district to the redirect URI you have configured in your Instant Login settings.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/fa2ff9c-Testing.png \"Testing.png\")\n\nOnce you have successfully completed this login, you can test with additional users following the steps below.\n\n## \n\nTesting with multiple users\n\n[](#testing-with-multiple-users)\n\nFollow the steps below to simulate incoming teacher signups by using a “Sign Up with Clever” URL below.\n\nWe’ve created a sandbox district just for this purpose with test teacher and student accounts for you to test with. The sandbox contains multiple teacher accounts with corresponding classes and students and has district ID = `5b2ad81a709e300001e2cd7a`. To make the testing process simpler, we can add a `district_id` param on the end of the URL to skip the school picker and go straight to the sandbox district's login page:\n\n`https://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri={YOUR REDIRECT URI}&client_id={YOUR CLIENT ID}&district_id=5b2ad81a709e300001e2cd7a`\n\nThis will automatically take you to the login screen for the sandbox district:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/61042fd-Screen_Shot_2018-07-28_at_8.13.52_PM.png \"Screen Shot 2018-07-28 at 8.13.52 PM.png\")\n\n## \n\nThe Teacher Experience\n\n[](#the-teacher-experience)\n\nWe've created a number of identical test teachers with classes that you can use to test your integration with. These teachers each teach 3 classes with 1, 2, and 2 students respectively.\n\nTeacher username = **_teacherX_** where _X_ is a number beween 1-20, e.g. _teacher1_  \nTeacher password = **_clever_**\n\nAfter you log in, you'll see the OAuth consent screen:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/592ec28-Screen_Shot_2018-07-28_at_8.22.33_PM.png \"Screen Shot 2018-07-28 at 8.22.33 PM.png\")\n\nWhen we log into the example app above using _teacher1_, we can see that the teacher account has been provisioned and data synced:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/137aaf7-Screen_Shot_2018-07-28_at_8.28.33_PM.png \"Screen Shot 2018-07-28 at 8.28.33 PM.png\")\n\n## \n\nThe Student Experience\n\n[](#the-student-experience)\n\nTo test the student experience, you must use a student that has already been shared by his/her teacher. So if you used _teacher1_ initially, you'll need to log in with a student from _teacher1_.\n\nStudent username = **_studentX-Y_** where _X_ is the teacher number and _Y_ is between 1-5, e.g. _student1-1_  \nStudent password = **_clever_**\n\nPlease review the [integration requirements](/docs/classroom-guide#section-integration-requirements) and [Data Model and Quirks](/docs/data-model-quirks-and-supported-features-classroom-integrations) sections to ensure your integration is ready for certification.",
