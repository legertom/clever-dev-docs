Please reference our [Data Model](/docs/data-model) and [our Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/developer-collections/overview) pages for further details and the full API schema.\n\n* * *\n\n## \n\nNotable Changes\n\n[](#notable-changes)\n\n### \n\nNew User Data Object\n\n[](#new-user-data-object)\n\nAPI v3.0 introduces `/users` as an endpoint bringing students, teachers, staff, district admins, and contacts under one object, individually queryable by adding a role type parameter (e.g., `/users?role=teacher`).\n\n### \n\nImproved Student Contact Relationships\n\n[](#improved-student-contact-relationships)\n\n-   **Student Relationships Array**: Contacts now include a `student_relationships` array, detailing all relationships the contact has with students in their district's Student Information System (SIS).\n    -   Each entry in the array represents a specific relationship, identified by both the **relationship type** and the **Clever ID of the student**.\n    -   For example, if a contact is listed as a parent for two students and an aunt to another, they will have one Clever ID and three entries in the `student_relationships` array.\n\nLearn more [here](/docs/student-contacts).\n\n### \n\nNew Content/Resource Mapping API\n\n[](#new-contentresource-mapping-api)\n\nSee the changelog below. Learn more [here](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360052615892?language=en_US).\n\n* * *\n\n## \n\nIdentity API\n\n[](#identity-api)\n\nClick to view the changelog for the Identity API\n\n#### \n\nChanged\n\n[](#changed)\n\n-   The `type` field on `/me` will now return `\"user\"` for any user records instead of a specific role type.\n\n* * *\n\n## \n\nData API\n\n[](#data-api)\n\nClick to view the changelog for the Data API\n\n#### \n\nAdded\n\n[](#added)\n\nUsers record type, which replaces District Admins, Staff (formerly known as School Admins), Teachers, and Students, and associated endpoints:\n\n-   GET `/users`\n    -   `role` parameter, which can be used to filter responses to users that have a specific role\n-   GET `/schools/{id}/users`\n    -   `role` parameter, which can be used to filter responses to users that have a specific role\n-   GET `/sections/{id}/users`\n    -   `role` parameter, which can be used to filter responses to users that have a specific role\n-   GET `/users/{id}`\n-   GET `/users/{id}/district`\n-   GET `/users/{id}/schools`\n-   GET `/users/{id}/myteachers`\n-   GET `/users/{id}/mystudents`\n-   GET `/users/{id}/mycontacts`\n-   GET `/users/{id}/sections`\n-   GET `/users/{id}/resources`\n-   Contacts now return `student_relationships`, which defines the Contact's `type` and `relationship` with a specific `student`. This replaces the previous top-level `type` and `relationship` fields.\n-   Staff records return `roles`, which shows the permissions this user has in Clever.\n-   Staff records can now be accessed on a per-school basis:\n    -   GET `/schools/{id}/users?role=staff`\n-   GET `/schools/{id}/users` returns all users for the specified school, even if the school is not the primary school for the user.\n-   Terms and Courses can now be accessed on a per-school basis:\n    -   GET `/schools/{id}/courses`\n    -   GET `/schools/{id}/terms`\n    -   GET `/courses/{id}/schools`\n    -   GET `/terms/{id}/schools`\n\n#### \n\nChanged\n\n[](#changed-1)\n\n-   School Admins are now referred to as `Staff`.\n-   GET `/schools/{id}/users` returns all users associated with that school, even if their primary school is not `{id}`.\n\n#### \n\nRemoved\n\n[](#removed)",
