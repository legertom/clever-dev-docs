Initiate a login. You can do this one of three ways:\n\n-   Go to the district overview in your Clever dashboard. Copy the Portal URL, and after logging in, click your application's icon.\n-   Go to the district overview in your Clever dashboard. Copy the Instant Login link and log in there.\n-   Use a Log in with Clever button.\n\n2.  All sandboxes should be set up so the default credentials are:\n\n-   Student: username and password are the student's `student_number` (e.g., 243615677)\n-   Teacher: username and password are the teacher's `teacher_number` (e.g., 215041)\n-   School admin: username and password are the school admin's `staff_id` (e.g., 12342)\n-   District admins may only be tested in [custom sandbox districts](/docs/custom-sandbox-districts).\n\nYou can download the default district CSVs to test other users [here](https://assets.clever.com/devdocs/default_sandbox_data.zip).\n\nIf you're using a [custom sandbox](/docs/custom-sandbox-districts) district instead, you must configure and review your Single Sign On user credentials settings.\n\n## \n\nSecure Sync only: SSO debugging tools\n\n[](#secure-sync-only-sso-debugging-tools)\n\nIn the Data Browser, open up the Detail View for a user where there is a link to log in as the user. This link sends a user-authenticated request to your app, so you can see what the user sees when they access your app through Clever.\n\nThis works for all user types that your application supports: students, teachers, school and district admins.\n\n![1290](https://files.readme.io/4e40e39-debugging-instant-login.png \"debugging-instant-login.png\")",
