  "content": "Once you have the code, you can exchange it for access and identity tokens. To do this, you POST to `https://clever.com/oauth/tokens`. To assert the identity of your application, use Basic Authentication with your Client ID and Client Secret to formulate an HTTP Authentication header.\n\n### \n\nUsing Basic Authentication\n\n[](#using-basic-authentication)\n\nHTTP client libraries offer a few methods to compute basic authentication. If your library supports setting a username and password, you'll want to set the `username` to your Client ID and the `password` to your Client Secret.\n\nHTTP Basic auth headers are also easy to compute yourself. Start by constructing a string containing your Client ID followed by a colon (\":\") character and your Client Secret, then encode that string in Base64. Set your Authorization HTTP header to this encrypted string preceded by the keyword Basic and a space:\n\n`basic_auth_header = \"Authorization: Basic \" + Base64.encode(client_id + \":\" client_secret)`\n\n### \n\nBuilding your POST Body\n\n[](#building-your-post-body)\n\nClever accepts POSTs to oauth/tokens using both traditional web POST bodies of the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` variety in addition to `application/json`. Make sure to always tell Clever what kind of content you're sending with an explicit Content-Type HTTP header.\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> Other POST body types, including `multipart/form-data`, are not accepted. If you receive 'invalid request / invalid content-type' error messages, make sure you're using either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json`\n\nEnsure that you're properly escaping values in your POST bodies. In either approach, use UTF-8 characters. Proper URL-encoding is required for application/x-www-form-urlencoded requests.\n\nHTTP libraries typically will take care of computing your Content-Length header — it is also required for POST requests.\n\nThe body of the request must have the following parameters:\n\n**Parameter**\n\n**Example**\n\n**Description**\n\n`code`\n\n`heRte321`\n\nThe exchange code received on your redirect URI\n\n`grant_type`\n\n`authorization_code`\n\nThe type of exchange; always `authorization_code` in this sequence\n\n`redirect_uri`\n\n`https://flightschool.edu/oauth`\n\nThe _exact_ redirect URI at which the `code` was received\n\nHere's what a POST looks like using `application/x-www-form-urlencode` - note that the redirect URI is properly URL encoded:\n\n```\nPOST https://clever.com/oauth/tokens\nAuthorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET>\nContent-type: application/x-www-form-url-encoded\nContent-length: 107\ncode=heRte321&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fflightschool.edu%2Foauth\n```\n\nAnd here it is with `application/json`\n\n```\nPOST https://clever.com/oauth/tokens\nAuthorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET>\nContent-type: application/json\nContent-length: 113\n{\"code\":\"heRte321\",\"grant_type\":\"authorization_code\",\"redirect_uri\":\"https://flightschool.edu/oauth\"}\n```\n\n### \n\nAcquiring the Token\n\n[](#acquiring-the-token)\n\nClever will respond with tokens as long as:\n\n-   `client_id` and `client_secret` are valid\n-   `redirect_uri` matches where Clever sent the code\n-   `code` is valid\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Codes are valid for one minute, and may only be exchanged once.\n\nThe response looks like (`id_token` only present for apps configured for OIDC):\n\n```\nHTTP 200 OK\nContent-type: application/json\nContent-length: 33\n{\n      \"access_token\":\"access_token_here\"\n      \"id_token\":\"id_token_here\"\n}\n```\n\nUpon receiving this JSON response and storing tokens in whichever way is appropriate for your environment, you'll want to use it either the access token or the ID token to determine more information about its owner.\n\nIn the next step, we'll see how to find a user's Clever ID and figure out what type of user it belongs to. Access tokens should be stored in a secure place to use when you're making requests to the data API on behalf of that user.\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> Tokens expire after 24 hours and cannot be refreshed - do not store the token for long-term user identification. User sessions expire after 2 hours.\n\n## \n\nUsing the Tokens\n\n[](#using-the-tokens)\n\nOnce an access token is acquired, it can be used at the `https://api.clever.com/v3.0/me` endpoint - this endpoint should return the user's Clever `id`, `district` ID, and the token `type`.\n\nTypically, once you've obtained the access token you will want to immediately determine its owner. Access tokens obtained through Clever SSO grant access to a subset of Clever's Data API.\n\nIdentity tokens contain basic user information in the tokens themselves. This information is stored in a set of claims that have been Base-64 URL encoded. While you can decode the token directly, we recommend using a [language-specific library](https://jwt.io/libraries) to decode and verify the token.\n\n### \n\nUsing bearer tokens\n\n[](#using-bearer-tokens)\n\nYou now have an access token. It is yours to bear. Your application is the bearer of that access token. It is now your bearer token and it symbolizes the relationship between the user and your application.\n\nBearer tokens are easily used with any HTTP library that allows you to manually specify an HTTP Authorization header.\n\nYour Authorization header value will be a string containing the word Bearer followed by a space character and then the access token value you received after exchanging your code.\n\nIf we were to issue a request using the bearer token we received in the last step, jsfUI2131da2f, our authorization header would look something like:\n\n```\nGET https://api.clever.com/some_clever_resource\nAuthorization: Bearer jsfUI2131da2f\n```\n\n## \n\nWorking with Third-Party Authentication Services\n\n[](#working-with-third-party-authentication-services)\n\nOne of the benefits of OpenID Connect is that it specifies a standard way for identity providers to share configuration information, which means that connecting with any third-party authentication service only requires providing a few key details.",
