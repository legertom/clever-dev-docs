  "content": "## \n\nAPI Access\n\n[](#api-access)\n\nTo request access to Clever's Attendance API, please email the Clever Partner Engineering team ([\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e48d8a9081839685908d8b8a97a4878881928196ca878b89)). Once approved, you will be granted attendance data scopes as well as access to a Clever-managed sandbox district containing demo attendance data.\n\n## \n\nDistrict Ingestion\n\n[](#district-ingestion)\n\nTo send attendance data to Clever, and subsequently to your application, districts must first sync attendance data to Clever. For this current iteration of attendance data ingestion, districts must use SFTP to sync CSV files exported from their SIS. Other forms of automated syncing do not currently support attendance data imports. To learn more about sync types, see [this Help Center article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/202289278?language=en_US).\n\n### \n\nattendance.csv\n\n[](#attendancecsv)\n\nThe columns for attendance.csv are listed below:\n\n-   Student\\_id\n-   School\\_id\n-   Section\\_id\n-   Attendance\\_date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n-   Attendance\\_type (daily, section)\n-   Attendance\\_status (absent, tardy, present)\n-   Excuse\\_code\n-   Attendance\\_id\n\n## \n\nIncremental Updates\n\n[](#incremental-updates)\n\nOur Attendance API is designed for incremental updates. Districts are not required to upload their full attendance history with every sync. Instead, the system accepts new or modified attendance records, streamlining data transfer and minimizing load. This allows districts to update attendance data efficiently without needing to resend unchanged records.\n\n## \n\nRetention Policy\n\n[](#retention-policy)\n\nClever will store attendance records for 6 months past the date indicated in the `attendance_date` field.",
