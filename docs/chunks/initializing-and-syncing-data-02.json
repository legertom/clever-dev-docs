  "content": "### \n\nGrade\n\n[](#grade)\n\n`grade` is set by the SIS if present. If not set by the SIS or if all sections in the data have the same grade, Clever will automatically assign a grade for each section based on the most common grade of enrolled students. Not all SISs have the concept of a section's grade, so this data is not always reliable.\n\nWe do not recommend setting curriculum based on section grade. Wherever possible, use students' grades instead.\n\n### \n\nTeachers\n\n[](#teachers)\n\nIn addition to the primary `teacher`, we provide the `teachers` list, which returns an array containing the primary teacher and any co-teachers in the class.\n\n## \n\nConnecting Students and Teachers\n\n[](#connecting-students-and-teachers)\n\nSections usually represent real-world classrooms, making them a critical resource for your application in setting up relationships between students and teachers.\n\nThe `students` array on the section contains one or more Clever IDs representing students in the section, while the `teacher` and `teachers` fields may contain one or more Clever IDs representing teachers associated with the section. Through a section, you'll find a teacher's students and a student's teachers.\n\nSections have their own `school` field, independent of the school directly associated with students and teachers. In [Clever's Data Model](/docs/data-model), as in the real world, students and teachers may be enrolled in sections that do not necessarily correlate to what you may consider their \"home school.\" In other words, **if a section belongs to School A, it may be taught by a teacher in School B and have students enrolled from School C.**\n\n## \n\nDisplaying Section Data to Students and Teachers\n\n[](#displaying-section-data-to-students-and-teachers)\n\nSIS section names are not always intuitive to users, so think through usability implications when displaying them in your user interfaces. If you want to display the section name as-is from Clever, **we encourage allowing your users to modify the name (and not allowing future syncs to overwrite user edits)** or implementing an additional \"Display name\" field.\n\nLeverage additional metadata about sections (such as teacher and period info) so users don't have to rely solely on section names to identify classes.\n\n## \n\nFiltering for Specific Sections\n\n[](#filtering-for-specific-sections)\n\nIf your application has specialized section needs (e.g., only syncing mathematics or special education courses), there are few ways to ensure you receive the relevant records. First, Clever provides tools on the district side that allow for very granular sharing, so this is the first line of defense against overshared data. You can also set a [globally recommended sharing template](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043113752-For-App-Partners-Setting-up-recommended-sharing-for-districts) in your Clever dashboard's District Setup page, giving district administrators a starting place for sharing the right data (for example, math sections for grades 2 through 8).\n\nClever also allows your support and implementation teams to [filter out schools and sections broadly](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003249203-For-App-Partners-Creating-filters-for-district-data) for each school district from within the Clever dashboard.\n\nIf certain sections with attributes should always be blocked from coming over to your program, we can also employ a set of [Data Errors](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/215806337-For-App-Partners-Verifying-district-data-quality).\n\nMost districts will leverage Clever's sharing systems to share only the data your application needs, but you may find yourself wanting to programmatically parse and filter sections based on your own criteria.\n\nWhile Clever normalizes the `subject` field in API responses, there may be situations where districts cannot provide Clever with a subject that is automatically categorizable. Certain subjects required by your app may be categorized as \"other\" or even as \"interventions/online learning.\"\n\nYou may also need to load sections belonging to a particular grade, such as \"all 9th grade math classes.\" Many school districts do not have grade information available for sections, so we do not recommend tying filtering logic strongly to section `grade` fields.\n\nRather than filtering on section or grade, it's best to retrieve all data shared with your application and apply logic on your backend. One way to do this is to load Clever data into a temporary/staging area and allow an administrator or support team member to select which sections, or types of sections, should be loaded into your application via an interface.\n\n## \n\nStudent-Teacher Associations Without Sections\n\n[](#student-teacher-associations-without-sections)\n\nIn addition to sections, you can also pull student-teacher associations via the GET /users/{id}/myteachers and GET /users/{id}/mystudents endpoints.\n\nThis allows you to associate students and teachers without organizing them into classrooms based on sections.\n\n## \n\nData Requirements and Exception Handling\n\n[](#data-requirements-and-exception-handling)\n\nSometimes school data will contain incomplete information. It is important to determine how your application will handle this.\n\n### \n\nClever's Approach\n\n[](#clevers-approach)\n\nClever's priorities (in order) when handling school SIS data are:\n\n1.  Share only data authorized by the district (e.g., if a district limits sharing to one school, do not share any data outside of that scope).\n2.  Share all the data authorized by the school (e.g., make all students, teachers, and sections from that school available through the API).\n3.  Standardize and clean up the data being shared (i.e., normalize race codes between SISs/districts).\n4.  Alert schools and developers to missing or low-quality data (e.g., show data warnings for teachers without an email address).",
