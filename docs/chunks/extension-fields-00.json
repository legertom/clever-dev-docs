Instead, these fields will appear on the record as an extension field.\n\n## \n\nWhich records can have extension fields?\n\n[](#which-records-can-have-extension-fields)\n\nExtension fields are currently available for:\n\n-   Schools\n-   Sections\n-   Teachers\n-   Students\n-   Staff\n\nWe plan to add support for extension fields for School Administrators by Back to School 2019-20.\n\n## \n\nAre fields normalized?\n\n[](#are-fields-normalized)\n\nBecause fields are created and populated by the district outside of our schema, we cannot normalize the data within the field. Additionally, there are no constraints on what districts can use as a field name.\n\n## \n\nAccessing extension fields\n\n[](#accessing-extension-fields)\n\n## \n\nSetting your application up to receive extension fields\n\n[](#setting-your-application-up-to-receive-extension-fields)\n\nIn order to receive extension fields, you'll need to add the fields to the list of fields you will accept in your Data Access settings (Settings > Data Access). You'll need to mark the `ext` field as optional for any record types you'll support.\n\n![593](https://files.readme.io/00640d3-data_access.PNG \"data access.PNG\")\n\nSettings > Data Access\n\nFor more information on Data Access and how to use it, check out our [guide to field-level sharing](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000216886).\n\n## \n\nHow districts add and share extension fields\n\n[](#how-districts-add-and-share-extension-fields)\n\nIf you're interested in seeing the district experience or testing extension fields using a sandbox, [check out these instructions](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024370912).",
