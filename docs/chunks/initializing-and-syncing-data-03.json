  "content": "In light of these priorities, Clever has adopted a permissive data schema with very few required fields (generally, a name, a Clever ID, and a unique identifier). When schools share incomplete records with Clever (e.g., a student with no grade level), rather than reject the record, Clever accepts the record and flags the quality issue as a \"Data Warning.\"\n\n### \n\nHandling Exceptions\n\n[](#handling-exceptions)\n\nBy design, Clever will always represent district data as it exists in the SIS. It is crucial to never make assumptions about Data API fields not specified in the Clever Schema. Applications written against the Clever API often have supplemental data requirements beyond Clever's required fields - \"students must have birthdays,\" for example. Best practices for dealing with this scenario include:\n\n-   **Let Clever know your application's data requirements.** With this information, Clever will customize and display Data Warnings for your application and request that districts share all fields your application requires.\n-   **Fail gracefully when data requirements are not met.** Consider an application that requires all students to have a valid birthday. How should this application handle a student record in Clever without a birthday field?\n    -   **Failed:** Processing a student record with a missing birthday raises an unhandled exception. The sync fails, and many valid records are not processed.\n    -   **Better:** Processing a student record with a missing birthday generates a handled error and a log entry. That student's account will need to be \"resynced\" manually at some point, but all valid records are processed.\n    -   **Best (strict):** Processing a student record with a missing birthday generates a handled error and a log entry. All other valid records are processed. If a student's record is updated to include a birthday, the account will be created then.\n    -   **Best (permissive):** Student records with missing birthdays receive temporary \"filler\" birthdays so accounts can be automatically created. Filler birthdays are replaced by actual birthdays if the student's data is updated.\n\n## \n\nInvalid Characters/Data, Max Character Lengths, or Duplicates\n\n[](#invalid-charactersdata-max-character-lengths-or-duplicates)\n\nLet Clever know so we can flag these as data warnings for your districts. As for handling these errors, our best practice is to generate a log entry if values are invalid, duplicated, or exceed max character lengths. Wherever possible, you should transform, ignore, or truncate the string or substitute a temporary \"filler\" value as a placeholder.\n\nClever supports all UTF-8 characters, and your application should expect to receive special characters that might be found in names/email addresses such as _', -, ñ, à_, etc.\n\n## \n\nData Not in Clever's Schema\n\n[](#data-not-in-clevers-schema)\n\nClever provides a normalized set of information that all applications need from the SIS - unfortunately, this also means that we may not have data your application requires in our schema.\n\n### \n\nData That Can Be Approximated/Inferred from Clever Data\n\n[](#data-that-can-be-approximatedinferred-from-clever-data)\n\nA great example is the graduation year, which is in our schema but not a required field. The best method is: when a student is created, set their graduation year based on the current school year and their grade. This field should be editable (not overwritten by updated information), but administrators should be able to edit the graduation year value after the student is created. We call this the \"editable island.\"\n\n### \n\nData That Cannot Be Approximated/Inferred from Clever Data\n\n[](#data-that-cannot-be-approximatedinferred-from-clever-data)\n\nIf you need data we cannot send (e.g., product license codes), you will need a separate system for ingesting this data and associating it with the records in your database.\n\n## \n\nEditing Clever-synced Data\n\n[](#editing-clever-synced-data)\n\nDeciding whether to allow manual updates or overrides to Clever data is the most important design decision you will make as you build an integration with Clever. The approach you take will have a major impact on data integrity, school satisfaction, and code complexity.\n\n### \n\nStrategies for Editing Clever-synced Data\n\n[](#strategies-for-editing-clever-synced-data)\n\n#### \n\nSIS Lockdown\n\n[](#sis-lockdown)\n\nTreat the district SIS data (as transmitted through Clever) as the single source of truth for roster information. All data from Clever is authoritative and can't be modified, deleted, or added to. Users may be able to edit supplemental data (e.g., setting a student's nickname, as this is not a Clever-provided field).\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n-   Simple development with no conflict resolution.\n-   Encourages good data practices with schools (e.g., all students must be promptly added to the SIS), pleasing district administrators.\n-   Easy to explain to administrators and teachers.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n-   Teachers must rely on district SIS data fidelity and data being kept up-to-date.\n-   May require development to \"lock down\" product UI if current UI supports manual updates.\n\n#### \n\nTwo-Way Sync\n\n[](#two-way-sync)\n\nMerge SIS data coming through Clever with manual changes teachers and/or administrators make to roster information in your app. All data can be edited by hand by users with appropriate permissions.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n-   Very flexible, giving teachers and/or administrators the ability to resolve changes themselves.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n-   Complex development.\n-   High risk of sync conflicts or users \"fighting\" the sync (e.g., user adds student to class, but student is removed from class on the next Clever sync).\n-   Can be difficult to explain to teachers/administrators.\n\n#### \n\nPartial Lockdown\n\n[](#partial-lockdown)",
