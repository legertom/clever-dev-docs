The certification process varies depending on the integration type you've chosen. Below are the different certification processes based on the integration type:\n\n1.  [**Clever Library Certification**](/docs/library-certification-guide)\n2.  [**District Single Sign-On (SSO) Certification**](/docs/district-sso-certification-guide)\n3.  [**Rostering (Secure Sync) Certification**](/docs/secure-sync-certification-guide)\n\nIf you're unsure which integration type to pursue, use the [Integration Picker](https://airtable.com/shrUp8n3bkdGIBkGh) to help determine the best option for your app.\n\nOnce you've selected your integration type, you'll need to collaborate with your development team to start building the integration. Here are some helpful resources to guide you through each integration:\n\n-   [District SSO Overview](/docs/identity-api)\n-   [Getting Started in the District](/docs/district-getting-started)\n-   [Getting Started in the Library](/docs/classroom-getting-started)\n\n* * *\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> **Multiple Certifications**\n> \n> You can be certified for multiple integration types. Here's how the certification process works:\n> \n> -   If you are building **Library** and **District SSO** integrations simultaneously, submit for certification **once**.\n> -   If you are building **Library** and **Secure Sync** integrations simultaneously, submit for certification **separately**.\n> -   If you are building **District SSO** and **Secure Sync** integrations simultaneously, submit for certification **once** in the **Secure Sync** form.\n> -   If you are building integrations for multilple applications, submit for **each certification** individually.",
