  "content": "Clever's iOS application is used strictly for authentication using a Clever Badge and does not house the iOS Clever Portal. If a user is not using a Clever Badge to authenticate, they will be redirected to the Safari browser to authenticate into their Portal using their identity provider (e.g. Google, Azure, Clever).\n\nFrom the Clever Portal, users will then select an application. If an application's redirect URL is registered as a universal link, the user will then be navigated to the native iOS application. If not, the user will be redirected to a webpage in-browser.\n\nTo learn more about the end-user experience for Clever on iOS/iPadOS, see this article:[For Clever Admins: iOS devices & the Clever app](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360024746971?language=en_US)\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Unsupported iOS Versions\n> \n> The [Clever iOS application](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clever/id1134186971) requires the following:\n> \n> iOS 12.0 or later\n> \n> iPadOS 12.0 or later\n> \n> This application is not required for SSO with an iOS device. It is mostly used to facilitate the use of [Clever Badges](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/220213907?language=en_US).\n\n# \n\nSSO Patterns on iOS/iPadOS\n\n[](#sso-patterns-on-iosipados)\n\n### \n\nI have a native iOS app\n\n[](#i-have-a-native-ios-app)\n\nThe best way to build out SSO is to use [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/)! Check out [Instant Login into Native iOS Apps](/docs/il-native-ios) for instructions on getting integrated.\n\n### \n\nI don't have a native iOS app, but my application supports mobile browsers on iOS\n\n[](#i-dont-have-a-native-ios-app-but-my-application-supports-mobile-browsers-on-ios)\n\nGreat! There's not much additional work needed to make this work.\n\nIdeally, your primary redirect URL should either be optimized for mobile or detect that a user is on an iOS device and redirect them to the mobile-optimized experience.\n\n### \n\nMy application does not support users on iOS\n\n[](#my-application-does-not-support-users-on-ios)\n\nNo worries! If you don't support users on iOS, please reach out to our support team in our [Help Center](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/?language=en_US) chat. We will disable logins from our iOS application.\n\nAdditionally, please make sure your primary redirect URL detects whether the user is logging in on an iOS device and displays a page telling them iOS is not supported - this will help appropriately route users who attempt to log in from the mobile web.",
