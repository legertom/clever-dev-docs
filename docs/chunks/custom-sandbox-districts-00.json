  "content": "A sandbox district is a demo district account, populated with demo data, that your team manages for development purposes. Developer accounts are automatically populated with a sandbox dataset upon creation. Clever also allows developers to create custom sandbox school districts to help build and test your integration if necessary.\n\nEach application may create sandboxes adhering to the following guidelines:\n\n-   Maximum of 5 sandbox districts\n-   Name districts with the following convention: `#DEMO <app name>` (e.g. `#DEMO ReadingFun Sandbox District`)\n\nCreating your own sandbox is a great way to understand the experience districts have setting up Clever and your application. You'll also have the opportunity to control the data Clever sends your application. You'll be juggling multiple accounts to administrate your sandbox.\n\n## \n\nCreating a sandbox district\n\n[](#creating-a-sandbox-district)\n\nTo create a sandbox district, reach out to [our support team](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us) with the following information:\n\n1.  A valid email address not currently associated with any application or sandbox district accounts\n2.  The desired name of the sandbox district\n\nOur team will get you set up with a new custom sandbox!\n\n## \n\nSetting up your sandbox\n\n[](#setting-up-your-sandbox)\n\n## \n\nStep 0: Finishing account creation\n\n[](#step-0-finishing-account-creation)\n\nWhen our team creates a sandbox district on your behalf, you'll receive an email at the address you specified that welcomes you to Clever and asks you to set up the password for the district administrator account we've created for you.\n\nOnce you've set up your account, you'll be able to log in to the district dashboard:\n\n![755](https://files.readme.io/c85323d-Setup_District.png \"Setup District.png\")\n\n## \n\nStep 1: Configure data sync\n\n[](#step-1-configure-data-sync)\n\nClick the \"Configure data sync\" link to get started.\n\n![764](https://files.readme.io/900e6b0-Select_SIS.PNG \"Select SIS.PNG\")\n\nYou can choose any SIS from this list as long as you make sure that you select the option to **Manually send data to Clever with SFTP**\n\n![775](https://files.readme.io/5c229a8-sync_type.PNG \"sync type.PNG\")\n\nUpon completing this step, you'll be taken to the Sync Settings page, which will allow you to sync data. Details on how to do this are covered in the [Uploading Data](/docs/custom-sandbox-districts#section-uploading-data) section below.\n\n## \n\nStep 3: Configure Instant Login\n\n[](#step-3-configure-instant-login)\n\nClick the \"Home\" icon to return to the dashboard main page and click the \"Configure login method\" link.\n\n![695](https://files.readme.io/c85a5cd-configure_logins.PNG \"configure logins.PNG\")\n\nClick the \"Add IDP\" button in the upper-right corner to add additional login methods.\n\n![875](https://files.readme.io/e910a26-select_idp.PNG \"select idp.PNG\")\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Choosing an Identity Provider\n> \n> You can add as many IDPs as you'd like, but at a minimum we recommend choosing the Clever Authentication option as it is easiest to set up and best for general testing use.\n\n### \n\nConfiguring Clever Authentication\n\n[](#configuring-clever-authentication)\n\nUpon selecting Clever Authentication, you'll be presented with a walkthrough that allows you to set the username and password formats for each user type.\n\n![632](https://files.readme.io/6de217d-configure_clever_auth.PNG \"configure clever auth.PNG\")\n\nFor testing purposes, we recommend choosing the following username and password formats for Clever Authentication:\n\n-   Students: Student number / Student number\n-   Teachers: Teacher number / Teacher number\n-   Admin: Staff ID / Staff ID\n\nAdditionally, we recommend unchecking the \"Allow `user type` to change their passwords\" and \"Force `user type` to change their password on first login\" options to keep the credentials consistent across your testing period.\n\n## \n\nUploading data\n\n[](#uploading-data)\n\nNow that you have a sandbox district and have added your application, it's time to populate it with data! If you set your district up with the SFTP sync method, you navigate to Settings > Sync Settings to sync data:\n\n![1900](https://files.readme.io/cbd82c9-sync_settings.PNG \"sync settings.PNG\")\n\nYou can either connect via a SFTP client or use the 'Upload' link to submit your files - please note that you will need to provide at least the following five files every time you sync data:\n\n-   `schools.csv`\n-   `students.csv`\n-   `teachers.csv`\n-   `sections.csv`\n-   `enrollments.csv`\n\nNote: `admins.csv`, which is used to provision school admins, is not required.\n\n## \n\nSample data\n\n[](#sample-data)\n\n-   [Clever USD (default)](https://assets.clever.com/devdocs/cleverusd.zip) - a 249-school data set made up of anonymized real district data. This provides a realistic dataset for a large school district.\n-   [Certification ISD](https://assets.clever.com/devdocs/CertificationISD.zip) - a 5-school data set that we built to contain as many edge cases as possible. This allows you to test the worst of the worst district data. For more information, check out [Testing Your Sync](/docs/sync-testing).\n\n## \n\nLinking a sandbox district to your dev app\n\n[](#linking-a-sandbox-district-to-your-dev-app)\n\n### \n\nStep 1: Grab the District Signup URL from your application settings\n\n[](#step-1-grab-the-district-signup-url-from-your-application-settings)\n\n![969](https://files.readme.io/8184856-app_Settings.PNG \"app Settings.PNG\")\n\n### \n\nStep 2: Log out of your application acount and log in to your district account\n\n[](#step-2-log-out-of-your-application-acount-and-log-in-to-your-district-account)\n\n### \n\nStep 3: Navigate to your District Signup URL\n\n[](#step-3-navigate-to-your-district-signup-url)\n\n### \n\nStep 4: Complete the flow by answering the questions to add the application.\n\n[](#step-4-complete-the-flow-by-answering-the-questions-to-add-the-application)\n\n## \n\nLinking a sandbox district to your PROD app\n\n[](#linking-a-sandbox-district-to-your-prod-app)\n\nYou'll need to use a different method to connect the sandbox to your production app.\n\n### ",
