Below, we've outlined key design decisions for building your integration with our API.\n\n## \n\nDistrict-level vs School-level Endpoints\n\n[](#district-level-vs-school-level-endpoints)\n\nClever's top-level endpoint is the school district. For example, you can use /users to pull records at the district level or, if your data model is aligned to school-level organizations, iterate across schools using /schools/{id}/users.\n\nWhen using /schools/{id}/users, note that Clever includes all students and teachers associated with a given school's enrollments, even if this is not their primary school. If you only intend to pull users with primary school association, you can add the parameter `primary=true` to your API calls (e.g., schools/{Id}/users?primary=true).\n\n## \n\nProvisioning Users\n\n[](#provisioning-users)\n\nAPI v3.0 introduces /users as an endpoint bringing students, teachers, staff, district admins, and contacts under one object, individually queryable by adding a role type parameter (e.g., /users?role=teacher).\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> **Use the Clever User ID as your primary identifier**\n> \n> Clever **does not verify user email addresses**, and some users may not have an email on record. District-managed identifiers like SIS IDs are unique only within a district. To reliably identify users across Clever, always key off the Clever User ID.\n> \n> [Learn more about Clever User IDs](/docs/users)\n\n### \n\nUsers vs. Role-Specific Calls\n\n[](#users-vs-role-specific-calls)\n\nDepending on your data model, it might be advantageous to provision accounts by pulling in all users for a district or school and parsing the `role` in the API response to assign permissions.\n\nReview the roles and data fields you require access to in the [Data Access tab of your Clever dashboard](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000216886-For-App-Partners-District-data-Access). If you do not require a specific role, such as contacts, disabling them within Data Access will omit these records from appearing in any `/users` calls, improving your efficiency in parsing records.\n\nYou can make role-specific calls to the API in provisioning user accounts, but be aware that multi-role users will show up multiple times (e.g., a staff member who is also a teacher).\n\nNext, we'll discuss design considerations in working with each user type.\n\n### \n\nStudents and Teachers\n\n[](#students-and-teachers)\n\n#### \n\nStudents in More Than One Class\n\n[](#students-in-more-than-one-class)\n\nIt's common for students to have more than one class and for several of these classes to be shared with your application. If your application supports only one classroom per student, we can work with districts to limit oversharing. However, consider workarounds for cases where the student must have multiple classes in the data shared from Clever.\n\nOne strategy is to create multiple student records tied to the same Clever ID, one for each class. When a student signs in, they can pick which class to sign into. On logout (or with a drop-down or toggle in the UI), they can choose to switch to another class.\n\nSome applications choose to assign the student a default primary class using the first or last class that is shared. This can be tricky if a student's enrollment data changes after the fact.\n\nSome applications assign students to a self-generated course if a student has multiple sections. This allows the student to use their account, though they will not belong to either of the courses synced from the district SIS.\n\n#### \n\nStudents and Teachers with No Classes\n\n[](#students-and-teachers-with-no-classes)\n\nIt's possible to see students and teachers in our API that are not associated with any sections, even if only in small numbers. How will you handle these users if your application requires users to have classes?\n\nMany applications allow for students and teachers to exist without classes, albeit often with a more limited product experience.\n\nSome applications create these accounts but display an error message to the user informing them they need to belong to a class to use the application.\n\nOther applications skip provisioning these user records entirely.\n\n#### \n\nMulti-site Users\n\n[](#multi-site-users)\n\n[Clever's Data Model](/docs/data-model) associates students and teachers with a primary school but also allows these records to be associated with sections at any school. Syncing from `/schools/<id>/users` includes all students and teachers with enrollments at each school site.\n\nIf your application allows each student or teacher to be associated with only one school, carefully consider how you will handle this use case.\n\nIf your data model does not handle multi-site users, the best strategy is to make sections school-agnostic. Any student and teacher can be associated with a section, and users can access a section at any school as long as they are enrolled as a student or teacher.\n\nYou could also create multiple user records tied to the same Clever ID, one for each class at each school. When a user signs in, they can pick which class to sign into. On logout (or with a drop-down or toggle in the UI), they can choose to switch to another class.\n\nOther applications default to supporting a student or teacher's primary school but not the additional sites.\n\n#### \n\nSensitive Data for Students\n\n[](#sensitive-data-for-students)\n\nData such as `iep_status`, `ell_status`, and `frl_status` are opt-in values for both the district and the application. By default, you will not receive these fields unless you indicate they are necessary for your application from within your Clever dashboard's Data Access tab in Settings.\n\n### \n\nDistrict Admins and Staff\n\n[](#district-admins-and-staff)\n\nClever supports two administrator-level user types.
