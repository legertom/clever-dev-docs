Code and packages using TLS 1.0 or 1.1 can no longer make requests to api.clever.com.\n\nBy moving away from outdated and insecure TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols, which have known weaknesses, Clever wants to make sure that our users’ data is transported with better security via our API endpoints. This migration elevates the security posture of Clever and our application partners, and ultimately helps ensure private data of millions of teachers and students who rely on Clever are well protected.\n\nBelow are tips and tools to use when migrating to TLS 1.2 with major tech stacks.\n\n## \n\nJava\n\n[](#java)\n\n**If your application runs on Java 1.7 or Java 1.6** (update 111 or later), you can set the _https.protocols system property_ when starting the JVM to enable additional protocols for connections made using the HttpsURLConnection class – for example, by setting\n\n```java\nDhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2\n```\n\n**If your application runs on Java 1.6 prior to update 111, or earlier**, TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are not supported. Therefore, you need to update the version of Java your application runs on.\n\nIf you use another library for connections such as _Apache HttpClient_, see the Apache-HttpClient section below.\n\n## \n\nApache-HttpClient\n\n[](#apache-httpclient)\n\nPlease leverage SSLConnectionSocketFactory to set the TLS version on your connections. See this helpful [guide](https://www.baeldung.com/apache-httpclient-tls) for details.\n\n```java\nSSLConnectionSocketFactory sslsf = new SSLConnectionSocketFactory(\n  SSLContexts.createDefault(),\n  new String[] { \"TLSv1.2\" },\n  null,\n  SSLConnectionSocketFactory.getDefaultHostnameVerifier());\nCloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom().setSSLSocketFactory(sslsf).build();\n```\n\n## \n\nJakarta Commons-HttpClient\n\n[](#jakarta-commons-httpclient)\n\nThis package has reached its [end of life](https://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/features.html). Please upgrade to use Apache-HTTPClient and follow the guide above to make sure you use TLS 1.2\n\n## \n\n.NET\n\n[](#net)\n\n## \n\nBuilt-In Client\n\n[](#built-in-client)\n\nIf you are using a builtin .NET client to make requests to Clever’s API, please see [this detailed guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls#%23configuring-security-via-appcontext-switches-for-net-framework-46-or-later-versions) on how to upgrade to TLS 1.2 across various versions of .NET framework.\n\n## \n\nRestSharp\n\n[](#restsharp)\n\nIf you are using [RestSharp](https://app.launchdarkly.com/) to communicate with Clever, you will need to add the following line above the first request you make to Clever. See the [issue here](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/1075) for relevant discussion.\n\n```text\nServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls;\n```\n\n## \n\nPython\n\n[](#python)\n\n## \n\nurllib3\n\n[](#urllib3)\n\nIf you are using the Urllib3 package with python 3.6, please use pyOpenSSL package to make sure you can upgrade to TLS 1.2.\n\n```python\npython3 -m pip3 install pyOpenSSL\n```\n\nIn [certain cases](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/contrib/pyopenssl.html#module-urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl), you might have to opt into using pyOpenSSL by the following:\n\n```python\nimport urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl\nurllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()\n```\n\n## \n\nlibcurl\n\n[](#libcurl)\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu, you will need to take package updates. You can do this by running the following:\n\n```python\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade openssl\n```\n\nYou may also need to update your libssl. You can update this by running:\n\n```python\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade libssl-dev\n```\n\nIf you are using RedHat Enterprise Linux, or CentOS:\n\n```python\nsudo yum update openssl libcurl\n```\n\n## \n\nGo\n\n[](#go)\n\nIf you are using a newer version of go ( Go 1.13 or above), Go already supports TLS 1.2 by default, so you will not need to make any changes.\n\nWhen using older version of Go, make sure to set your TLS Client Configuration’s MinVersion to explicitly use TLS 1.2.\n\n```go\nTLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{\n        MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,\n    }\n```\n\nIf you are using the fasthttp library, please follow the instructions in this issue to properly create a [TLS configuration](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/issues/431).",
