In the event that something unusual happens and the user is authenticated through Clever and redirected to your `redirect_uri` in an error state, we'll provide an `error` parameter instead of an `access_token` on the URI fragment you receive.\n\nIn practice, such errors are rarely programmatically recoverable based on their disposition. If you receive one of these errors, display a simple message to your end user and allow them to try again. Consult section 4.2.2.1 of the OAuth 2.0 specification for more information.",
