  "content": "Clever SSO allows your application to connect to ADFS, Azure Active Directory, Google, Stoneware, Clever Badges, and more with a single integration. By supporting SSO, any Clever user can sign in to your application with the credentials they already know no matter which identity provider their district is using.\n\nIn this section, we'll go through how users can log in to your application, the mechanics behind it, and how to set up SSO for your application.\n\n## \n\nOAuth2 Authorization Grant Flow\n\n[](#oauth2-authorization-grant-flow)\n\nClever uses OAuth 2.0, an open standard used by many other identity providers (Google, Facebook, etc). If you've already worked with OAuth 2.0 before, you can skip to [Enabling SSO in Clever](/docs/classroom-with-oauth#section-enabling-sso-in-clever)\n\n[The OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) defines several methods of getting access to the API – the most common, and the one used here, is the Authorization Grant flow.  \nHere are the steps that are taken once the login is started:\n\n1.  Clever redirects the user to your application's redirect URI with a code appended\n2.  Your application POSTs the code back to Clever's Identity API and requests a bearer token\n3.  Clever responds with the token for the user\n4.  Your application uses the bearer token at GET `https://api.clever.com/v3.0/me` to get the user ID\n5.  Your application uses the token against Clever's Data API to acquire any additional information you need\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> The following fields are available at our /me endpoints:\n> \n> **Teacher object data**\n> \n> -   Clever ID - globally unique and stable ID for each user, created by Clever\n> -   Name (first, middle, last)\n> -   Email\n> \n> **Student object data in those sections**\n> \n> -   Clever ID (this is not sis\\_id or student\\_number; it’s a GUID generated by Clever)\n> -   Name (first, last intial)\n> -   Grade (if available from the SIS)\\*\n> \n> Section data is available in our Data API. We will review this information in [Classroom Rostering](/docs/classroom-rostering)\n\n## \n\nEnabling SSO in Clever\n\n[](#enabling-sso-in-clever)\n\n## \n\nRequirements\n\n[](#requirements)\n\n-   [A development application](/docs/getting-started)\n\n## \n\nEnabling SSO\n\n[](#enabling-sso)\n\nAt the bottom of [your application's settings page](https://apps.clever.com/applications), you'll see your app's OAuth Settings.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/560e0d2-Clever___Application_Settings.png \"Clever___Application_Settings.png\")\n\nHere, you'll **define your Redirect URIs** - the URL to which Clever will redirect your users and add a code at the start of the Authorization Grant flow. You can have more than one redirect URI, but please note that Clever will direct users to the first one in the list by default.\n\n## \n\nRedirect URI Requirements:\n\n[](#redirect-uri-requirements)\n\n-   The redirect URI should point to a location where you expect to receive users' login attempts\n-   Development applications can use non-HTTPS URIs, but please note that all production applications are required to use HTTPS URIs\n\nYou'll also want to **enable SSO for users** - use the dropdown to select which user types your application will support. Your application will only allow logins from users of the selected types. If not added:\n\n-   Users of the unselected type(s) will see a Clever error message if they attempt to log in through an Instant Login Link or Log In With Clever button.\n-   Students & Teachers: the application will not appear in their Clever Portal\n\n## \n\nAuthenticating Users\n\n[](#authenticating-users)\n\n## \n\nAcquiring a Code\n\n[](#acquiring-a-code)\n\nWhen a user attempts to log in to your application, Clever will redirect them to your application. If the login is Clever-initiated (Portal or Instant Login Link), this will be your primary redirect URI. If the login is from a LIWC button, you may specify a different redirect\\_uri.\n\nWhen a user is redirected to your redirect URI, you'll find the `code` parameter attached with a variable length string as its value:\n\n`https://primary.redirect?code=code`\n\nAt this point, you won't know who the user is or what type of user they are, but grab the code - you won't need to persist it for too long, but you will need it for the next step.\n\n### \n\nRedirect URI Parameters\n\n[](#redirect-uri-parameters)\n\nHere are the parameters you can expect to see Clever add when redirecting users to your primary or specified redirect URI:\n\nParameter\n\nGuaranteed\n\nValue\n\n`code`\n\nYes\n\nCode generated by Clever\n\n`scope`\n\nYes\n\nScope assigned to your application by Clever\n\n`state`\n\nOnly if provided via LIWC link\n\nState value provided by your LIWC link\n\n## \n\nExchanging the Code for a Token\n\n[](#exchanging-the-code-for-a-token)\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> It may take your application a few seconds to complete these next steps of the token exchange sequence. We recommend rendering a user interface as quickly as possible while you take care of these server-side steps in the background.\n\nOnce you have the code, you should exchange it for a token. To do this, you POST to `https://clever.com/oauth/tokens`. To assert the identity of your application, you must use your Client ID and Client Secret to formulate an HTTP Authentication header.\n\n### \n\nUsing Basic Authentication\n\n[](#using-basic-authentication)\n\nHTTP client libraries offer a few methods to compute basic authentication. If your library supports setting a username and password, you'll want to set the `username` to your Client ID and the `password` to your Client Secret.\n\nHTTP Basic auth headers are also easy to compute yourself. Start by constructing a string containing your Client ID followed by a colon (\":\") character and your Client Secret, then encode that string in Base64. Set your Authorization HTTP header to this encrypted string preceded by the keyword Basic and a space:\n\n`basic_auth_header = \"Authorization: Basic \" + Base64.encode(client_id + \":\" client_secret)`\n\n### \n\nBuilding your POST Body\n\n[](#building-your-post-body)",
