The reliability, formatting, and source of student contact information vary depending on the underlying SIS or approach used to communicate this data to Clever.\n\n## \n\nThe Contact User Object\n\n[](#the-contact-user-object)\n\nIn v3.0 of our Data API, contacts will now be returned as users within the district on the `/users` endpoint. All contacts will be associated with at least one student but can be associated with multiple through the `student_relationships` field.\n\nPlease refer to [the User section of Clever's Data Model](/docs/users) for a list of attributes associated with the user object and a sample user record response from `/users`.\n\nThe full contact name will be stored in the `last_name` field of the user object. This decision was made based on how contacts have been historically ingested in Clever and stored in SISs.\n\n## \n\nStudent Relationships\n\n[](#student-relationships)\n\n`student_relationship` will return an array of three fields: `relationship`, `student`, and `type`. A contact will have a single `student_relationship` for every instance they appear as a contact within the SIS. For example, if a user is listed as an uncle to two students and a parent to another, they will have one Clever ID but will receive 3 values in the `student_relationship` response.\n\nHere is an example of a contact record with multiple student relationships:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"created\": \"2022-11-28T18:46:36.819Z\",\n        \"district\": \"6385008f69df036e83e984a3\",\n        \"email\": \"[email protected]\",\n        \"last_modified\": \"2024-11-04T21:05:06.631Z\",\n        \"name\": {\n            \"last\": \"Aaron Collins\"\n        },\n        \"id\": \"63850203bfb8460546071ef6\",\n        \"roles\": {\n            \"contact\": {\n                \"phone\": \"1-(330) 280-1898\",\n                \"phone_type\": \"Other\",\n                \"sis_id\": \"\",\n                \"student_relationships\": [\n                    {\n                        \"relationship\": \"Aunt/Uncle\",\n                        \"student\": \"63850203bfb8460546071e62\",\n                        \"type\": \"Family\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"relationship\": \"Aunt/Uncle\",\n                        \"student\": \"672936fc65fc4500ced13260\",\n                        \"type\": \"Family\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"relationship\": \"Parent\",\n                        \"student\": \"63850203bfb8460546071e6e\",\n                        \"type\": \"Parent/Guardian\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"legacy_id\": \"63850203bfb8460546071e7e\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## \n\nKeeping Contacts Stable\n\n[](#keeping-contacts-stable)\n\nIt's important to note that the stability of a contact's Clever ID is dependent upon a number of factors.\n\n-   If the contact record _does_ have an `sis_id`, the contact will retain the same Clever ID when any contact info changes (for example, `phone`, `email`, or `name`). The only case where a contact’s Clever ID will change is if that contact’s `sis_id` changes (similar behavior to a student or teacher record).\n    \n-   If the contact record _does not_ have an `sis_id`,\n    \n    -   If contact has `name` and `email`, then the contact Clever ID is derived from a concatenation of `name` + `email`.\n    -   If contact doesn't have `email` but has a `name` and `phone number`, then contact Clever ID is derived from a concatenation of `name` + `phone`.\n    -   If they don’t have either `email` or `phone number`, then contact Clever ID is derived from a combination of `name`, contact `type`, `relationship`, and `phone type`.\n-   Not all SISs have `sis_id` for contact data. In other cases, the field may exist but is not populated. If you find that districts you work with are missing `sis_id` for contact data, we recommend you contact the district directly or contact [Clever Support](https://support.clever.com) to assist the district with updating the data.\n    \n\n## \n\nAccessing Contacts\n\n[](#accessing-contacts)\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Processing student\\_relationships\n> \n> Contact information is especially sensitive for privacy and security purposes. Please ensure that the correct `relationship` is tied to the correct student when assigning privileges in your database.\n\n## \n\nSyncing Contacts First\n\n[](#syncing-contacts-first)\n\nIf your application focuses on contact data, you should sync through all users within a district using [GET /users](/reference/getcontacts) or add a `?role` parameter to filter for contacts. You will then be able to retrieve associated students given a Clever ID by using [GET /users/{id}/mystudents](/reference/getcontactsforstudent).\n\n## \n\nContact Data by Student\n\n[](#contact-data-by-student)\n\nClever has offered support for retrieving contact data by student for some time. Given a Clever ID for a specific student, you can retrieve a collection of the contacts associated with that student using [GET /users/{id}/mycontacts](/reference/getcontactsforstudent).\n\nThis approach is not recommended for applications requiring all contact data within a district, but works well for ad hoc access patterns.\n\n## \n\nHow Contact Data Varies\n\n[](#how-contact-data-varies)\n\nIn most cases, Clever developers never need to worry about the underlying SIS a district uses. Due to the wide variance in SIS support for contact records, we recommend applications making extensive use of Contacts data to be aware of these particulars and to be extra tolerant of unusual formatting as Clever does not normalize all data from these fields.\n\nPlease refer to [this article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115002711943?language=en_US) in our Help Center for more detailed information on how student contacts are ingested from a district's SIS into Clever.\n\n### \n\nSFTP\n\n[](#sftp)",
