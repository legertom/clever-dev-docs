  "content": "Welcome! This guide will walk you through upgrading your application from Clever API v2.x to v3.x, equipping you with the key changes, best practices, and decision points to support a smooth upgrade.\n\n> ## 🤔\n> \n> Questions?\n> \n> If you have specific questions about your current implementation or specific challenges, feel free to contact [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c353228393b2e3d283533322f1c3f30392a392e723f3331) and we'd be happy to work through those with you.\n\n# \n\nMigration Checklist\n\n[](#migration-checklist)\n\n-   ☑️ Audit current usage of role-based endpoints\n-   ☑️ Identify where Clever IDs are stored or referenced\n-   ☑️ Migrate to storing the v3 User ID\n-   ☑️ Update all user-related API calls to use /v3.1/users\n-   ☑️ Update logic that filters or processes events\n-   ☑️ Review your handling of multi-role users\n-   ☑️ Test against demo districts with v3 data\n\n# \n\nWhat's New in v3.x?\n\n[](#whats-new-in-v3x)\n\nThe most significant change in v3.x is **user consolidation**: all users (students, teachers, staff, admins) are now represented by a unified **Multi-Role User** object.\n\n### \n\nKey Benefits:\n\n[](#key-benefits)\n\n-   One user = one Clever ID\n-   More accurate role tracking\n-   Better support for users with multiple roles (e.g., teacher + staff)\n-   **New features**\n    -   **Clever LMS Connect (v3.1)**\n        -   API v3.1 introduces the Gradebook Sync API, which enables your app to support connections between your app, Clever, and the biggest LMS providers on the market. Learn more information here: [Clever LMS Connect - Overview](/docs/lms-connect-overview)\n    -   **Enhanced user demographic data (v3.1)**\n        -   We've included additional demographic data points, such as `student.section_504_status` and `student.disability.disability_status`.\n    -   **Attendance Data Support (v3.1)**\n        -   Coming soon!\n    -   **Content Mapping (v3.0+)**\n        -   API v3.0 introduced the Content Mapping API, which allows districts to map specific resources to a course in Clever.\n        -   This associates the resource with not only the course, but also related **sections and users**, which can be used to inform downstream user routing, or content access.\n        -   See this page for more information: [Resources](/reference/resources-1)\n\nFor more exhaustive changes in API v3.x, please refer to our existing doc pages on v3.0 and v3.1:\n\n-   [What's new in API v3.0?](/docs/new-in-api-v3)\n-   [What's new in API v3.1?](/docs/api-v31)\n\n# \n\nSummary of Breaking Changes\n\n[](#summary-of-breaking-changes)\n\nArea\n\nv2.x\n\nv3.x\n\nUser Endpoints\n\nRole-specific endpoints (e.g., /teachers, /students, etc.)\n\nConsolidated role endpoints; filter by role (e.g., /users?role=teacher, /users?role=student, etc.)\n\nUser IDs\n\nRole-specific\n\nRole-agnostic\n\nEvents API\n\nFilter by record\\_type= to obtain specific user events\n\nAll user events returned; filter in application by role\n\nRelated Endpoints\n\nUses legacy role-based IDs\n\nUses Multi-Role User ID\n\n# \n\nTesting the v3.x endpoints (recommended)\n\n[](#testing-the-v3x-endpoints-recommended)\n\nPrior to beginning your upgrade work, we recommend testing the v3.x endpoints to familiarize yourself with the changes and responses in API v3.x. This will be particularly useful for understanding how user records are displayed, along with their role(s).\n\nThe best way to do this is by using the [Clever API Developer Collection in Postman](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/workspace/developer-collections/overview). Please see [this page](/docs/exploring-the-clever-api) for more information on accessing the collection and interacting with the Clever API.\n\n# \n\nSteps to upgrade\n\n[](#steps-to-upgrade)\n\n## \n\n1\\. Audit current usage of role-based endpoints\n\n[](#1-audit-current-usage-of-role-based-endpoints)\n\nTo begin, we recommend reviewing your integration for any endpoints that currently rely on role-based querying to obtain the relevant user data. For example, this includes, but is not limited to:\n\n-   `/v2.0/students`\n-   `/v2.0/teachers/{id}`\n-   `/v2.1/teachers/{id}/sections`\n-   `/v2.1/school_admins/{id}`\n\nAny endpoint in your existing integration that currently makes calls to the above or similar endpoints for user-related data will need to be updated to use their v3.x equivalent. You should take note of what endpoints your integration currently uses, and be prepared to update those once you've completed the next step - Migrating to the v3.x User ID.\n\n## \n\n2\\. Migrate to the v3.x User ID\n\n[](#2-migrate-to-the-v3x-user-id)\n\nIn v3.x, every user has a new universal Clever User ID. **This ID is the same in v3.0 and v3.1**. You must update your application's database to associate users with their new ID, as your application will need to refer to this new ID for all calls that require a specified user ID, for example, `/v3.1/users/{id}`.\n\n> ## 💡\n> \n> Did you know?\n> \n> Students are the only user type whose **legacy\\_id** and **id** values on their user record will be the same, since they cannot be assigned multiple roles.\n\n### \n\nMigration Strategy:\n\n[](#migration-strategy)\n\n-   Fetch all users via /v3.1/users\n-   Match with existing records (email, SIS ID, etc.)\n-   Store the new user ID in your database\n-   Use v3 user ID in all related endpoint calls\n-   Request API v3.x Migration CSVs via the App Dashboard\n    -   This tool can be found under **Settings > District Setup**:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/be60b81e60b9cab7cde8d730d8bad13f9182de1c3ac099b832a0c5e70e4f94a1-image.png)  \n\n## \n\n3\\. Update your User Endpoints\n\n[](#3-update-your-user-endpoints)\n\n**Example use case:** Querying teacher accounts in bulk\n\n```Text\nGET /v2.1/teachers\nAuthorization: Bearer {district_app_token}\n```\n\n  \n\n```Text\nGET /v3.1/users?role=teacher\nAuthorization: Bearer {district_app_token}\n```\n\n### \n\nUser Endpoint Changes\n\n[](#user-endpoint-changes)\n\nv2.x\n\nv3.x\n\n/students\n\n/users?role=student\n\n/teachers\n\n/users?role=teacher\n\n/school\\_admins\n\n/users?role=staff\n\n/district\\_admins\n\n/users?role=district\\_admin",
