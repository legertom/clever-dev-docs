  "content": "All SIS data is loaded into the product via Clever and \"locked down\" so it can't be modified. However, teachers and/or administrators can create \"manually managed\" resources not synced. Automatically synced resources are clearly identified in the UI from manually-created resources.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n-   More flexible than a full \"lockdown\" approach by allowing users to add students and classes not in the SIS.\n-   Less complex than two-way merge (assuming UI indicates automatic vs. manual resources).\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n-   Requires more development work than the \"lockdown\" approach.\n-   Offers users less control than two-way merge for some scenarios (e.g., can't add one student to a class, instead need to manually create a new class with all students).\n\n#### \n\nManually-Triggered Sync\n\n[](#manually-triggered-sync)\n\nAllow manual updates in the product and give users the ability to pick and choose which updates from Clever to apply. Users could choose to load all data from Clever or sync specific sections.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n-   Gives users the ability to ignore data from the SIS (e.g., setting up groupings within the product that aren't overwritten on subsequent syncs).\n-   Gives users the ability to temporarily add information into the product if there's a lag in the SIS update (e.g., add a student to the product, then update from Clever when the SIS is updated).\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n-   Requires more development effort than other approaches.\n-   Handling conflicts between users could add complexity.\n\n## \n\nCustom Groups\n\n[](#custom-groups)\n\nOne key functionality teachers ask for is the ability to create custom groups within applications. There are a couple of ways to support this:\n\n### \n\nCreating Additional Groups\n\n[](#creating-additional-groups)\n\nThis generally requires a two-way sync or partial lockdown approach to syncing data. Provide teachers with the ability to create a new group, unaffected by ongoing Clever syncs, and populate it with Clever (and perhaps manually-created) students.\n\n**Pulling from Associated Students**\n\nUsing the GET /users/{id}/mystudents endpoint, you can provide the teacher with their Clever students. The teacher can then pick and choose which students to add to the group.\n\n**Copying Existing Classes**\n\nGive teachers a list of their sections and allow the teacher to select an enrollment group to pull into the new group. Once populated, the teacher can then add or remove students to the group.\n\n### \n\nSplitting Sections into Custom Sub-Groups\n\n[](#splitting-sections-into-custom-sub-groups)\n\nAllow a teacher to divide sections into several groups, each containing students in the section.\n\n![Section Subgroups](https://files.readme.io/dbffe2e-Section_subgroups.png)\n\nThe overall enrollment remains the same, but section subgroups are controlled by the teacher!\n\n## \n\nSync Frequency\n\n[](#sync-frequency)\n\nWe require applications to sync with Clever at least once per day.\n\nAdditionally, you should be able to sync new data on demand if a district has urgent data to sync or any issues arise.\n\n## \n\nHistorical Information\n\n[](#historical-information)\n\nSections represent an abstraction to connect students and teachers. It may be tempting to associate certain other data, such as coursework or assignments, to a section in your application. However, while a section may have the same name throughout the year, the students and teachers in that section will come and go. It's therefore important to associate data with less transient elements - coursework or longitudinal data should be associated (by Clever's `id`) with students, not sections.",
