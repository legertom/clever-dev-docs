Consider relaxing certain mandatory field requirements for Library-based teachers in order to streamline the first time experience in your application.\n\n## \n\nEncoding\n\n[](#encoding)\n\nClever supports all UTF-8 characters, and your application should expect to receive special characters that might be found in names/email addresses such as _', -, ñ, à,_ etc.",
