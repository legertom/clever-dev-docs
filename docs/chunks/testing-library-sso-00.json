You can find it at [https://apps.clever.com/{app\\_short\\_name}/library/integration\\_guide](https://apps.clever.com/%7Bapp_short_name%7D/library/integration_guide). We recommend clicking through each test to get a high level understanding of if your Library integration is working.\n-   _[SSO Test Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VTFeG9J9zvYNgyukEEW7iuNC_sv65pLoyxHa34DQgks/edit?gid=167761082#gid=167761082) (RECOMMENDED)_\n-   _Use an authorization link directly_  \n    https://clever.com/oauth/instant-login?client\\_id={YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_ID}&district\\_id=5b2ad81a709e300001e2cd7a\n    -   un: teacher1\n    -   pw: clever\n\n### \n\nSandbox Districts\n\n[](#sandbox-districts)\n\nTesting for Library should only be done on a specific Clever-managed sandbox district. The test options provided above account for this. Please do not test your Library integration against any other sandbox distrcits.",
