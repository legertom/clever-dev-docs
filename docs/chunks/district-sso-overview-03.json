Clever's discovery endpoint is:\n\n`https://clever.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n\nEven this endpoint is set up according to a standard format, so in many cases all you need to know is that Clever supports OIDC and the issuer is `https://clever.com`.\n\nThe discovery endpoint tells any authentication service where and how to kick off the authentication process, get tokens, and verify the tokens.\n\n## \n\nAn Example Configuration\n\n[](#an-example-configuration)\n\nSetting up OIDC with most authentication services usually only requires filling out a few fields. This example is for AWS Cognito, but the required fields should be similar for many other providers:\n\n![593](https://files.readme.io/f022a80-AWS_OIDC_configuration.png \"AWS OIDC configuration.png\")\n\nExample OIDC configuration for AWS Cognitio\n\n-   **Provider name:** this can be anything you'd like to use, but \"Clever\" makes a lot of sense here!\n-   **Client ID:** your application's Client ID, found on the Clever application dashboard\n-   **Client secret:** your application's Client secret. This is required for authenticating with Clever\n-   **Attributes request method:** Clever supports both POST and GET\n-   **Authorize scope:** Clever manages scopes through application configuration, so this is not required by Clever. However, some authentication services may still require a value of openid at a minimum\n-   **Issuer:** this is used to make a call to the discovery endpoint to grab the rest of the information needed to connect with Clever",
