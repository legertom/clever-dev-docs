Paginating only works with **district bearer tokens** provided through a **Secure Sync** subscription.\n\nQueries on the Clever API can return large numbers of results. To improve performance and make the data more consumable, the Clever API supports paginating large responses.\n\nTo iterate through results, you should follow the `rel:next` link contained with every set of results. For example, querying the `/users` endpoint with a **district bearer token** you might see the following:\n\n```\n\"links\": [\n    {\n      \"rel\": \"next\",\n      \"uri\": \"/v3.0/users?starting_after=530e5961049e75a9262cffe4\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\nThe link uses the starting\\_after parameter to jump to the next page of results. This form of pagination is called range-based pagination. Elements are returned sorted with ascending IDs (based on create time).\n\n## \n\nUsing relative links for pagination\n\n[](#using-relative-links-for-pagination)\n\nIf there are more results to consume, the response's links object will have a rel link called next, that lets you query the next page of results. Similarly, there may be a prev link for the previous page of results.\n\nExample links object for request GET /v3.0/districts?starting\\_after=53ced71e65a64d5918157c04:\n\n```\n\"links\": [\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"self\",\n        \"uri\": \"/v3.0/districts?starting_after=53ced71e65a64d5918157c04\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"next\",\n        \"uri\": \"/v3.0/districts?starting_after=56fad73b82c6fd818c6b48cc\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"prev\",\n        \"uri\": \"/v3.0/districts?ending_before=53ced71e65a64d5918157c04\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> starting\\_after queries may have prev links even when there are no previous results. Following such links will return an empty array of data. Similarly, ending\\_before queries may have next links even when there are no more results, and following those links will return an empty array.\n\n## \n\nLimits\n\n[](#limits)\n\nRather than serving every result at once, by default the Clever API limits the number of entries in responses to 100 per page. You can change the number of results returned by setting the limit parameter. For instance, `GET /v3.0/users?limit=30` returns at most 30 students\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Maximum limit\n> \n> The maximum limit is 10000 records per page.",
