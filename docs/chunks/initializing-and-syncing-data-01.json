  "content": "-   **District Administrators** have access to all data and features across a district's schools, sections, and students.\n-   **Staff** have access to a more narrow set of data associated with specific schools and sections. These users may be school principals, school tech leads, or others.\n\nNeither user type is provisioned by SIS data. See [our guidance for district administrators](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/202518038) to understand how these accounts are created.\n\n#### \n\nStaff\n\n[](#staff)\n\nTake note: unlike teachers, staff are not directly associated with any sections but rather are associated at the school level.\n\n#### \n\nMulti-role Users (Teachers, Staff, District Admins)\n\n[](#multi-role-users-teachers-staff-district-admins)\n\nIt's common for a staff member at a district to occupy several roles, for example, a teacher who is also a staff member or district administrator. These users require both teacher privileges, such as managing class enrollments, and admin privileges, such as assigning teachers to classes.\n\nAPI 3.0 recognizes each of these roles as data objects under one user with one Clever ID. For example, it's possible for a user to be a teacher, a staff member, and a district admin. When querying `/users`, this person's record will contain all three types. The same user will also appear when querying `/users?role=teacher`, `/users?role=staff`, or `/users?role=district_admin`.\n\nConsider what permissions are applied to multi-role users. Depending on your application, you may choose to default to higher-level access or permissions if a teacher is also a staff member. However, there are cases where a staff member who is also a teacher might receive only teacher-level access rights.\n\nIf your application does not support multi-role users, we recommend provisioning multiple accounts for each role and creating a UI to allow the user to toggle between accounts at sign-in.\n\n### \n\nContacts\n\n[](#contacts)\n\nContacts can also be pulled from `/users?role=contact`. If you plan on utilizing contact data, see [Contacts](/docs/student-contacts) for more information.\n\n## \n\nCourses and Terms\n\n[](#courses-and-terms)\n\nCourses and terms exist as top-level objects at the district level but can also be pulled at the school level.\n\n## \n\nCourses\n\n[](#courses)\n\n### \n\nBest Practices for Using Clever Courses\n\n[](#best-practices-for-using-clever-courses)\n\nIf your data model has school-specific courses instead of courses that belong to the whole district, you may need to create multiple copies of the Clever course for each school associated with that section.\n\nCourses do not list the IDs of related sections on the object itself; you'll want to use /courses/{id}/sections to get the related sections or first sync courses and then use the course ID on synced sections to create the link back to the course in your database.\n\n## \n\nWhat to Do if Your District Has No Courses\n\n[](#what-to-do-if-your-district-has-no-courses)\n\nCourses are only created if districts choose to sync that data. If courses are required, we can work with the district to add course information into Clever. Please have the district reach out to the Clever Support team to authorize the addition of data.\n\nAlternatively, some customers have seen success with administrators creating terms and courses within the application and then providing a UI for sections to be associated with the appropriate term/course.\n\n## \n\nTerms\n\n[](#terms)\n\n### \n\nBest Practices for Using Clever Terms\n\n[](#best-practices-for-using-clever-terms)\n\nTerms are closely associated with a district's semesters or quarters but can represent any period of time. For example, a year-long Algebra II section may have a “year” term starting on the first day of school and ending on the last day of school, while a semester-long Advanced Placement Calculus section may have a “semester 2” term starting in January and ending on the last day of school.\n\nWhen present, term information can be used to further separate sections into logical buckets. Some SISs may reuse sections term-to-term, updating enrollments, teachers, and term data for each section. Other districts may completely destroy sections as terms roll over, creating new sections with new Clever IDs. **Your application should handle both scenarios gracefully.**\n\nIf a term is deleted, deactivate the term. If the sections are still active, keep the sections as active. Users (or at least administrators) should be able to access old terms or reactivate them if they need to edit information on the terms.\n\n## \n\nWhat to Do if Your District Has No Terms\n\n[](#what-to-do-if-your-district-has-no-terms)\n\nTerms are only created if districts choose to sync that data. If terms are required, we can work with the district to add terms information into Clever. Please have the district reach out to the Clever Support team to authorize the addition of data.\n\n## \n\nProvisioning Sections\n\n[](#provisioning-sections)\n\nA section represents a specific instance of a class at a school, complete with a roster of students and any assigned teachers.\n\n## \n\nData Element Quirks\n\n[](#data-element-quirks)\n\n### \n\nSection Names\n\n[](#section-names)\n\n`name` is retrieved from the SIS if present. If the section name is not available, Clever will generate a name by concatenating `course_name`, `teacher.name.last`, and `period` with `\" - \"` between field components for certain SIS sync types. Because districts have different conventions around section names, Clever can't guarantee they will be intuitive, unique, or human-readable. **We encourage you to allow your users to modify section names.**\n\n### \n\nSubject\n\n[](#subject)\n\nSections are automatically categorized into subjects based on the section's `name` or `course_name`. While we do our best to automatically assign subjects, some sections may be categorized as \"Other\" or incorrectly categorized. We recommend allowing for flexibility and exception handling if you plan on using the `subject` field to filter or assign content in your product.",
