  "content": "If your application has district-specific login pages, you can also add `district_id`as a parameter on the URL to skip the school picker and go straight to the district's login page.\n\n  \n\nThis is also useful if you are testing with your sandbox district during development and want to skip the school picker.\n\n  \n\nExample:\n\n  \n\n```text\nhttps://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&district_id=YOUR_DISTRICT_ID\n```\n\n  \n\n### \n\nLIWC Button Assets\n\n[](#liwc-button-assets)\n\n  \n\nYou can find assets for LIWC buttons [here](/docs/clever-assets).\n\n## \n\nSetting Up SSO in Clever\n\n[](#setting-up-sso-in-clever)\n\n  \n\n### \n\nRequirements\n\n[](#requirements)\n\n  \n\n-   [A development application](/docs/getting-started)\n-   A sandbox district - when you sign up for your development application, one is automatically created for you. You can also [create your own custom sandbox district using these instructions.](/docs/custom-sandbox-districts)\n-   OIDC applications will need to contact [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4f26213b2a283d2e3b2620213c0f2c232a392a3d612c2022) to have the application configured for sending identity tokens.\n\n  \n\n### \n\nEnabling SSO\n\n[](#enabling-sso)\n\n  \n\nAt the bottom of [your application's settings page](https://apps.clever.com/applications), you'll see your app's OAuth Settings.\n\n  \n\n![](https://files.readme.io/f2b97d8-Clever___Application_Settings-2.png \"Clever___Application_Settings-2.png\")\n\n  \n\nHere, you'll **define your Redirect URIs** - the URL to which Clever will redirect your users and add a code at the start of the Authorization Grant flow. You can have more than one redirect URI, but please note that Clever will direct users to the first one in the list by default.\n\n  \n\n### \n\nRedirect URI Requirements:\n\n[](#redirect-uri-requirements)\n\n  \n\n-   The redirect URI should point to a location where you expect to receive users' login attempts\n-   Development applications can use non-HTTPS URIs, but please note that all production applications are required to use HTTPS URIs\n\n  \n\nYou'll also want to **enable SSO for users** - use the dropdown to select which user types your application will support. Your application will only allow logins from users of the selected types. If not added:\n\n  \n\n-   Users of the unselected type(s) will see a Clever error message if they attempt to log in through an Instant Login Link or Log In With Clever button.\n-   Students & Teachers: the application will not appear in their Clever Portal\n-   School & District Admins: the application will appear in their Clever Portal, but will have a flag indicating SSO is not supported for their user type. Clicking on the application icon will direct the user to the application's website\n\n  \n\n## \n\nAuthenticating Users\n\n[](#authenticating-users)\n\n  \n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Using Third-party Authentication Services\n> \n> If you are using a third-party authentication service, the steps below can be automatically performed after setting a few standard configuration fields. Visit [this section](#working-with-third-party-authentication-services) for more details.\n\n  \n\n### \n\nAcquiring a Code\n\n[](#acquiring-a-code)\n\n  \n\nWhen a user attempts to log in to your application, Clever will redirect them to your application. If the login is Clever-initiated (Portal or Instant Login Link), this will be your primary redirect URI. If the login is from a LIWC button, you may specify a different redirect\\_uri.\n\n  \n\nWhen a user is redirected to your redirect URI, you'll find the `code` parameter attached with a variable length string as its value:\n\n  \n\n`https://primary.redirect?code=code`\n\n  \n\nAt this point, you won't know who the user is or what type of user they are, but grab the code - you won't need to persist it for too long, but you will need it for the next step.\n\n  \n\n### \n\nRedirect URI Parameters\n\n[](#redirect-uri-parameters)\n\n  \n\nHere are the parameters you can expect to see Clever add when redirecting users to your primary or specified redirect URI:\n\n  \n\nParameter\n\nGuaranteed\n\nValue\n\n`code`\n\nYes\n\nCode generated by Clever\n\n`scope`\n\nYes\n\nScope assigned to your application by Clever\n\n`state`\n\nOnly if provided via LIWC link\n\nState value provided by your LIWC link\n\n  \n\n### \n\nExchanging the Code for a Token\n\n[](#exchanging-the-code-for-a-token)\n\n  \n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> It may take your application a few seconds to complete these next steps of the token exchange sequence. We recommend rendering a user interface as quickly as possible while you take care of these server-side steps in the background.\n\n  \n\nOnce you have the code, you can exchange it for access and identity tokens. To do this, you POST to `https://clever.com/oauth/tokens`. To assert the identity of your application, use Basic Authentication with your Client ID and Client Secret to formulate an HTTP Authentication header.\n\n  \n\n### \n\nUsing Basic Authentication\n\n[](#using-basic-authentication)\n\n  \n\nHTTP client libraries offer a few methods to compute basic authentication. If your library supports setting a username and password, you'll want to set the `username` to your Client ID and the `password` to your Client Secret.\n\n  \n\nHTTP Basic auth headers are also easy to compute yourself. Start by constructing a string containing your Client ID followed by a colon (\":\") character and your Client Secret, then encode that string in Base64. Set your Authorization HTTP header to this encrypted string preceded by the keyword Basic and a space:\n\n  \n\n`basic_auth_header = \"Authorization: Basic \" + Base64.encode(client_id + \":\" client_secret)`\n\n  \n\n### \n\nBuilding your POST Body\n\n[](#building-your-post-body)\n\n  \n\nClever accepts POSTs to `oauth/tokens` using both traditional web POST bodies of the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` variety in addition to `application/json`. Make sure to always tell Clever what kind of content you're sending with an explicit Content-Type HTTP header.\n\n  ",
