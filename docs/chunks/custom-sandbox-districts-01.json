To start, make sure you are logged into your sandbox district dashboard, and navigate to your application by clicking your app name/icon.\n\nNext, click over to the \"Data Sharing\" tab:\n\n![1478](https://files.readme.io/dcddfff-Screen_Shot_2018-01-02_at_11.28.50_AM.png \"Screen Shot 2018-01-02 at 11.28.50 AM.png\")\n\nFor testing purposes, you'll usually want to share by district. If you'd like to better understand the sharing options or share a specific subset of data, check out [our guide to sharing settings](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/203115007).\n\nAfter you've shared data, save the changes.\n\n## \n\nLaunch the district connection\n\n[](#launch-the-district-connection)\n\nAs the final step, you'll need to launch the district connection to complete the setup process.\n\nGo back to your app dashboard (log back in if necessary). On your Home screen, you should now see your new sandbox district marked with an orange \"Setting Up\" status indicator. On the right side of the page under Actions, click **Launch Now**.\n\n![1112](https://files.readme.io/7d6b8de-Image_2018-01-02_at_11.33.59_AM.png \"Image 2018-01-02 at 11.33.59 AM.png\")\n\nThat's it! You should now see the \"Launched\" blue status indicator for the new sandbox district.\n\nTo connect an existing sandbox district to additional applications, log in to your sandbox district and go to the application's District Signup URL. You'll then be prompted to authorize the additional application and share data!",
