Our goal is to provide the best possible experience for both your customers and your team when you go live with Clever.\n\nIntegrations must be secure, resilient, and scalable. Based on our experience with application partners across the country, we have devised core requirements that integrations must meet to connect with live districts and access production data, including user records and enrollment information.\n\nThe specific requirements are detailed in the following pages.\n\nAfter building and testing your integration with a Clever development app, submit a survey answering key questions about how it works. We will review your survey responses and your integration for architectural best practices.\n\n* * *\n\n### \n\nWhy Should I Certify?\n\n[](#why-should-i-certify)\n\n-   **Connect with real users**: Gain access to live districts and real user data.\n-   **Ease of use**: Simplify processes for your customers.\n-   **Compatibility**: Ensure your integration works seamlessly in the Clever ecosystem.\n-   **Visibility**: Be featured in the [Clever Application Gallery](https://clever.com/app-gallery).\n-   **Recognition**: Earn certification image assets for use on your website.\n\n* * *\n\n### \n\nWhat Should I Expect?\n\n[](#what-should-i-expect)\n\n![Certification Process](https://files.readme.io/fe85a1b-PE_Troubleshooting_Flow_Charts-Dev_Doc_Cert_What_to_Expect.drawio_1.png)\n\n* * *\n\n### \n\nHow Do I Get Started?\n\n[](#how-do-i-get-started)\n\n1.  **Review Certification Types**: Visit our [Certification Types](/docs/certification-overview) page.\n2.  **Choose Your Integration**: Decide which integration you would like to build.\n3.  **Follow the Guide**: Refer to the certification guide for your chosen integration.\n\n-   [Library Certification Guide](/docs/library-certification-guide)\n-   [District SSO Certification Guide](/docs/district-sso-certification-guide)\n-   [Secure Sync Certification Guide](/docs/secure-sync-certification-guide)",
