You may need to launch and then unlaunch the connection.\n-   **Development Tasks**\n    -   Process the state parameter and/or use a separate redirect URI for matching.\n-   **Edge Cases**\n    -   Handling multiple users trying to follow this flow to associate district ID.\n\n### \n\nAdmins Select District/Organization from List\n\n[](#admins-select-districtorganization-from-list)\n\nIn this flow, an admin (either internal or external) selects the district from a list of unmatched districts shared with the app. You can also do some name matching to get higher-likelihood matches to the top of the list or add a search feature.\n\n-   **Pros**\n    -   Can be fully self-serve or simplify work for your internal team.\n-   **Cons**\n    -   Still requires manual input.\n    -   Edge cases around picking the right account.\n-   **Development Tasks**\n    -   Build a filtering mechanism/UI.\n-   **Edge Cases**\n    -   District name is not always unique.\n    -   Possibility of mismatching, need to be able to correct this.\n    -   The admin user in your database may not be the same as the Clever district administrator.\n\n### \n\nEmail Matching\n\n[](#email-matching)\n\nTake a look at the data that’s being synced and compare the email addresses/domains to find the organization that contains those users.\n\n-   **Pros**\n    -   Can be fully automated.\n-   **Cons**\n    -   Lots of potential issues.\n-   **Development Tasks**\n    -   Matching data from API with organization data in the database.\n-   **Edge Cases**\n    -   Districts with multiple Clever accounts.\n\n## \n\nMatching Records\n\n[](#matching-records)\n\nWhen converting existing customers to a Clever sync, it will likely be necessary to match their existing data with data coming through Clever. Implement a strategy to manually match these records, but you can also use Clever's Matchmaker tool to bootstrap your matching for students, teachers, sections, and schools.\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> No matching approach will have a 100% success rate. Even if all data is \"clean,\" there are likely new records or expired records that will not match. Therefore, it's critical for a matching process to allow for a review of failed and questionable matches.\n\n## \n\nUsing a Matching Algorithm\n\n[](#using-a-matching-algorithm)\n\nIdentify fields in your existing data set that are unique and present in the Clever data feed. Match on these fields, and store Clever IDs so that future updates will be tied to the newly matched resources.\n\n### \n\nSchools\n\n[](#schools)\n\nMany developers find it relatively easy to match schools by hand (either by the developer or by the school admin) since school matching only has to be completed once. Alternatively, we provide MDR Number and NCES ID.\n\nMany schools in Clever have NCES IDs (either loaded from the SIS or pulled by Clever on developer request) which can help match schools. However, Clever doesn't have 100% coverage, and some schools don't have populated `nces_id`.\n\nClever now has robust coverage for `mdr_number` fields in U.S. school records.\n\n### \n\nUsers\n\n[](#users)\n\n#### \n\nStudents\n\n[](#students)\n\nTo match students in Clever with existing students in your product, developers have had success matching on the following fields, in order of most successful to least:\n\n1.  Primary ID numbers (`sis_id`, `student_number`)\n2.  Secondary ID numbers (`state_id`)\n3.  Birthdays (`dob`)\n4.  `email` address\n5.  `name`\n\n#### \n\nTeachers\n\n[](#teachers)\n\nTo match teachers in Clever with existing teachers in your product, developers have had success matching on the following fields, in order of most successful to least:\n\n1.  `email` address\n2.  Primary ID numbers (`sis_id`, `teacher_number`)\n3.  Secondary ID numbers (`state_id`)\n4.  `name`\n\n#### \n\nStaff\n\n[](#staff)\n\nTo match staff in Clever with existing staff in your product, developers have had success matching on the following fields, in order of most successful to least:\n\n1.  `email` address\n2.  `staff_id`\n3.  `name`\n\n#### \n\nMulti-Role Users\n\n[](#multi-role-users)\n\nClever recommends creating one account for any user with multiple roles. If your application has separate accounts for users that are both teacher and staff, associate each account with one Clever ID to allow the user to toggle between experiences with one login or select their intended role upon login. To consolidate accounts into one, iterate through each `role` response on the user object and match following the respective fields listed above. If the user matches multiple accounts in your system, associate each with the one provided Clever ID.\n\nIf you must create separate accounts for each user type, complete matching by role by adding the `?role` parameter to the user endpoint and using the respective fields listed above. Note: separate accounts will have one Clever ID for updates moving forward.\n\n### \n\nSections\n\n[](#sections)\n\nClever does not recommend matching existing sections to sections in Clever, as unique section identifiers rarely exist in existing data sets. If matching sections is essential to your application, matching on school and teacher will simplify the process.\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Clever does not recommend a fully automated match by name because it's common for more than one student in a district (or even more than one student in a school) to have the same name.\n\n## \n\nMatchmaker\n\n[](#matchmaker)\n\nYou can access Matchmaker by logging in to your Clever Dashboard and clicking 'Matchmaker' in the left menu bar. Matchmaker evaluates district data you already have and correlates it to data Clever has, relieving you of the burden of manually matching records.\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Matchmaker is currently only enabled for apps that support Secure Sync, as it requires access to full district records.\n\n### \n\nHow it Works\n\n[](#how-it-works)",
