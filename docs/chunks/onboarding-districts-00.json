Below are important design decisions and best practices for building your Instant Login integration.\n\n## \n\nHow Manual is Your Onboarding Process?\n\n[](#how-manual-is-your-onboarding-process)\n\nBefore designing your onboarding process with Clever, consider your current onboarding processes: how much data (or metadata) is manually entered or edited by your team members or by customers? How much of that is required?\n\nOur guidance is based on years of experience with customers of all sizes and product areas. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, but we present options that have worked and potential caveats.\n\n## \n\nObtaining District-App Tokens\n\n[](#obtaining-district-app-tokens)\n\nEvery time a district authorizes your application, a token is created that stores the details of this authorization. A token is a string of characters, for example: `7f76343d50b9e956138169e8cbb4630bb887b18`.\n\nTo automatically sync data for the district, store either the district's token or the Clever ID. Here’s how to access the tokens shared with your application.\n\n### \n\nManual Access\n\n[](#manual-access)\n\nAfter logging in to Clever, click on a district and choose to view or copy the token in the district's Overview.\n\n![district info](https://files.readme.io/77128e2-district_info.PNG \"district info.PNG\")\n\n### \n\nQuerying for Tokens\n\n[](#querying-for-tokens)\n\nUsing your app's client ID and secret, you can query the [`GET https://clever.com/oauth/tokens` endpoint](/docs/exploring-the-clever-api), which returns a list of every token granted to your application. For programmatic import of district tokens, we recommend this approach.\n\nYou can add a parameter with `GET https://clever.com/oauth/tokens?district=<id>` to retrieve a district-specific token.\n\n## \n\nAssociating Records with District-App Tokens\n\n[](#associating-records-with-district-app-tokens)\n\n### \n\nStoring District IDs\n\n[](#storing-district-ids)\n\nClever gives every record a globally-unique ID, including the district. By tying your top-level object to the Clever district ID, you can identify which token on `/oauth/tokens` you need to sync the data.\n\nThis allows your system to continue syncing automatically even if the token string for a district changes, as `/oauth/tokens` will always return the active token.\n\n### \n\nStoring Tokens\n\n[](#storing-tokens)\n\nIf you’re grabbing tokens manually or prefer not to refresh tokens every time you need to sync data for a district, you can store the district-app token. Note: storing IL bearer tokens is not recommended. If your only method of updating tokens is manual, please note this in the certification process. If a token is compromised, our team will coordinate rotating the token to minimize customer impact.\n\n## \n\nSelf-Serve Onboarding\n\n[](#self-serve-onboarding)\n\nHere are a few strategies we've seen applications use for matching Clever districts with database records that minimize work for your internal teams.\n\n### \n\nMatching on MDR Number\n\n[](#matching-on-mdr-number)\n\nClever supports district and school MDR numbers, and you can find this value in the `/v3.0/districts` and `/v3.0/districts/<id>` responses. If you store MDR numbers in your database, you can use this field to match Clever districts and internal organizations.\n\n-   **Pros**\n    -   Fields are automatically populated by Clever.\n    -   Clever can update these as necessary.\n-   **Cons**\n    -   Not available for all districts.\n    -   Requires access to the MDR database.\n-   **Development Tasks**\n    -   Adding MDR number to your organizations.\n    -   Comparing database ID to `district.mdr_number`.\n-   **Edge Cases**\n    -   Missing MDR numbers.\n    -   Clever districts that are not actual districts (e.g., single-school signups), and so will not have MDR numbers.\n\n### \n\nMatching Using Clever Instant Login\n\n[](#matching-using-clever-instant-login)\n\nWhen a [user logs in to your application through Clever](/docs/identity-api), the district ID is provided in the `/me` response. You can grab information from the user to match them to an organization in your database.\n\n-   **Pros**\n    -   Any shared user at the district can log in, providing district ID.\n-   **Cons**\n    -   Users might attempt to log in to your application before data is ready.\n-   **Development Tasks**\n    -   Build a matching algorithm to match user’s district ID with their organization within your app.\n-   **Edge Cases**\n    -   Handling multiple users trying to follow this flow to associate district ID.\n\n### \n\nUsing a Log in with Clever Button\n\n[](#using-a-log-in-with-clever-button)\n\nYou can use the optional state parameter on a LIWC link to link a district to their organization. Here’s the flow we've seen other apps use:\n\n1.  Embed the LIWC link in the admin dashboard or send it to the admin in an email. The link format will be `https://clever.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=<client id>&redirect_uri=<redirect uri>&response=code&state=<state input>`.\n    \n    -   The redirect URI can be separate from your primary redirect URI.\n    -   You should still use the state parameter to [prevent CSRF](/docs/il-security).\n2.  Once the user logs in, we'll send them to the specified redirect URI with the code and the state parameter, with the state input exactly as provided.\n    \n3.  Once the OAuth flow is complete, you can use the district ID from the user and the state parameter to determine which organization the user is associated with.\n    ",
