If you receive 'invalid request / invalid content-type' error messages, make sure you're using either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json`\n\n  \n\nEnsure that you're properly escaping values in your POST bodies. In either approach, use UTF-8 characters. Proper URL-encoding is required for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` requests.\n\n  \n\nHTTP libraries typically will take care of computing your Content-Length header — it is also required for POST requests.\n\n  \n\nThe body of the request must have the following parameters:\n\n  \n\n**Parameter**\n\n**Example**\n\n**Description**\n\n`code`\n\n`heRte321`\n\nThe exchange code received on your redirect URI\n\n`grant_type`\n\n`authorization_code`\n\nThe type of exchange; always `authorization_code` in this sequence\n\n`redirect_uri`\n\n`https://flightschool.edu/oauth`\n\nThe _exact_ redirect URI at which the `code` was received\n\n  \n\nHere's what a POST looks like using `application/x-www-form-urlencode` - note that the redirect URI is properly URL encoded:\n\n  \n\n```\nPOST https://clever.com/oauth/tokens\nAuthorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET>\nContent-type: application/x-www-form-url-encoded\nContent-length: 107\ncode=heRte321&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fflightschool.edu%2Foauth\n```\n\n  \n\nAnd here it is with `application/json`\n\n  \n\n```\nPOST https://clever.com/oauth/tokens\nAuthorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET>\nContent-type: application/json\nContent-length: 113\n{\"code\":\"heRte321\",\"grant_type\":\"authorization_code\",\"redirect_uri\":\"https://flightschool.edu/oauth\"}\n```\n\n  \n\n### \n\nAcquiring the Token\n\n[](#acquiring-the-token)\n\n  \n\nClever will respond with tokens as long as:\n\n  \n\n-   `client_id` and `client_secret` are valid\n-   `redirect_uri` matches where Clever sent the code\n-   `code` is valid\n\n  \n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Codes are valid for one minute, and may only be exchanged once!\n\n  \n\nThe response looks like (`id_token` only present for apps configured for OIDC):\n\n  \n\n```\nHTTP 200 OK\nContent-type: application/json\nContent-length: 33\n{\n      \"access_token\":\"access_token_here\"\n      \"id_token\":\"id_token_here\"\n}\n```\n\n  \n\nUpon receiving this JSON response and storing tokens in whichever way is appropriate for your environment, you'll want to use it as either the access token or the ID token to determine more information about its owner.\n\n  \n\nIn the next step, we'll see how to find a user's Clever ID and figure out what type of user it belongs to. Access tokens should be stored in a secure place to use when you're making requests to the data API on behalf of that user.\n\n  \n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> Tokens expire after 24 hours and cannot be refreshed - do not store the token for long-term user identification. User sessions expire after 2 hours.\n\n  \n\n## \n\nUsing the Tokens\n\n[](#using-the-tokens)\n\n  \n\nOnce an access token is acquired, it can be used at the `https://api.clever.com/v3.0/me` endpoint - this endpoint should return the user's Clever `id`, `district` ID, and the token `type`.\n\n  \n\nTypically, once you've obtained the access token you will want to immediately determine its owner. Access tokens obtained through Clever SSO grant access to a subset of Clever's Data API.\n\n  \n\nIdentity tokens contain basic user information in the tokens themselves. This information is stored in a set of claims that have been Base-64 URL encoded. While you can decode the token directly, we recommend using a [language-specific library](https://jwt.io/libraries) to decode and verify the token.\n\n  \n\n### \n\nUsing bearer tokens\n\n[](#using-bearer-tokens)\n\n  \n\nYou now have an access token. It is yours to bear. Your application is the bearer of that access token. It is now your bearer token and it symbolizes the relationship between the user and your application.\n\n  \n\nBearer tokens are easily used with any HTTP library that allows you to manually specify an HTTP Authorization header.\n\n  \n\nYour Authorization header value will be a string containing the word Bearer followed by a space character and then the access token value you received after exchanging your code.\n\n  \n\nIf we were to issue a request using the bearer token we received in the last step, jsfUI2131da2f, our authorization header, would look something like:\n\n  \n\n```\nGET https://api.clever.com/some_clever_resource\nAuthorization: Bearer jsfUI2131da2f\n```",
