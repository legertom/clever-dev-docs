  "content": "## \n\nMulti-role Users Overview\n\n[](#multi-role-users-overview)\n\n### \n\nPre API v3.0 Behavior\n\n[](#pre-api-v30-behavior)\n\nIn API v2.1 and earlier, each user type (students, teachers, school admins, district admins, and student contacts) was treated as a separate object. This required individual API calls and lacked a unified way to identify users with multiple roles. For example, a teacher with both teacher and staff accounts needed separate credentials for each role, creating confusion for end users and challenges for applications managing these accounts.\n\n### \n\nAPI v3.0 and Beyond\n\n[](#api-v30-and-beyond)\n\nWith the release of API v3.0, all user types were consolidated into a single user object. This change simplifies handling for education professionals with multiple roles, reduces API call complexity, and eliminates issues caused by duplicate accounts. By streamlining user management, Clever enables applications to better support users while ensuring accurate data ingestion and fewer redundancies.\n\nIf your application supports syncing teachers, staff (school admins), or district admins, it's likely multi-role users currently have separate accounts within your application and therefore receive a set of user permissions based on their role.\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> v3.0 Data Browser View (Secure Sync Only)\n> \n> Did you know that you can toggle your view of the Data Browser between v2 and v3? Look for the toggle in the top right corner of your Data Browser page.\n> \n> ![](https://files.readme.io/aca864a30802c09ade8acda015e1e08ca295902e925d7ea02dfd7fa257c4f139-image.png)\n\n## \n\nManaging Permissions, Access, and User Experience\n\n[](#managing-permissions-access-and-user-experience)\n\n### \n\nPermissions and Access\n\n[](#permissions-and-access)\n\nNow that one user record may have two or all three of these roles, you'll need to consider how you apply access permissions in your product. If, for example, a teacher should have edit permissions for their classrooms and an administrator should have view-all access to their associated school sites, then your application will need to govern their access by determining which classrooms a user directly teaches (/users/{id}/sections) and which schools they administer (/users/{id}/schools).\n\nIf permissions are more broadly defined, you could assign a maximum or minimum set of permissions based on which roles are present. For example, if a staff member should always have a super-set of permissions, then a teacher who is also a staff member (or becomes a staff member) should be assigned staff-level permissions.\n\n### \n\nUser Experience\n\n[](#user-experience)\n\nIf you have completely different user experiences for teachers, staff, and district admins in your application, consider providing an easy way for multi-role users to toggle between experiences in your UI.\n\n## \n\nLeveraging new staff roles\n\n[](#leveraging-new-staff-roles)\n\nThe user type previously called `school admins` is now `staff` to better represent a broader range of district and school roles beyond traditional admins or teachers. This change helps districts more accurately align user roles in Clever with specific job functions (counselors, custodians, librarians), improving flexibility and role clarity.\n\nWithin the `staff` response for users with a staff role is now another `roles` designation, indicating whether the user has access as a `PortalOnly` user or whether the district has designated them a `SchoolTechLead` in Clever. [School Tech Leads](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003207663-Clever-Roles-School-Tech-Lead) support classrooms in their use of technology and receive a special set of permissions and features in Clever. `PortalOnly` staff are given the standard portal experience.\n\nIn your application, you might consider granting `SchoolTechLead` users additional access or permissions not afforded to `PortalOnly` staff, based on how those who commonly receive this designation--ed tech coaches, technology specialists--currently support classroom learning with your application.\n\nThe `title` field is an optional field that districts can include in their SIS sync with Clever to specify the user's specific function within the district. For more information on the staff data model, please see this page: [Staff User Type](/docs/users#staff-user-type) Below, we've included an example staff user response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"created\": \"2022-11-28T18:46:36.799Z\",\n    \"district\": \"6385008f69df036e83e984a3\",\n    \"email\": \"[email protected]\",\n    \"last_modified\": \"2022-11-28T18:46:36.799Z\",\n    \"name\": {\n      \"first\": \"Lucy\",\n      \"last\": \"Freemont\"\n    },\n    \"id\": \"63850203bfb8460546071eef\", //Clever API v3.x ID (multi-role user ID)\n    \"roles\": {\n      \"staff\": {\n        \"credentials\": {\n          \"district_username\": \"[email protected]\"\n        },\n        \"department\": \"\",\n        \"roles\": [\n          \"PortalOnly\"\n        ],\n        \"schools\": [\n          \"63850203bfb8460546071e5f\"\n        ],\n        \"staff_id\": \"12342\",\n        \"title\": \"Principal\",\n        \"legacy_id\": \"63850203bfb8460546071ee2\" //Clever API v2.x ID\n      }\n    }\n  },\n```\n\n## \n\nMigrating users\n\n[](#migrating-users)\n\nWe now have a migration tool that can help you match user legacy IDs to their new v3.x user IDs! Find out more [here](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360043514192?language=en_US#Request%20API%20V3%20Migration%20CSVs).\n\nFor some applications, data need not be stored or revived every new school year for returning users. In these cases, the simplest migration path is to pick a date and time over the summer to switch over to API 3.0, when no users from the prior year are expected to still be using your program. When districts return for Back to School, you'll begin syncing with all new data.\n\nFor most partners, we'll want to ensure users are migrated seamlessly to version API 3.0.\n\n### \n\nStudents\n\n[](#students)\n\nAll student Clever IDs from all prior API versions will remain the same in API 3.x.\n\n### \n\nTeachers, Staff, District Admins",
