The Clever ID at the /users level should supersede all IDs in your database.\n\n### \n\nContacts\n\n[](#contacts)\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Upgrading from v2.x Contacts to v3.x Contacts?\n> \n> With v3.x of the Clever API, significant updates were made in how Clever handles student relationships with contacts (guardians). We recommend reviewing these pages for more information:\n> \n> -   [Contacts and Guardians](/docs/student-contacts)\n> -   [Migrating from v2.x Contacts to 3.x Contacts](/docs/migrating-from-v2x-contacts-to-v3x-contacts)\n\n### \n\nMulti-role users\n\n[](#multi-role-users)\n\nFor users that now have multiple roles, you'll want to merge records that had previously existed as separate users in prior API versions to the new user Clever ID.\n\nIf your application has separate accounts for users that are both teacher and staff, we recommend associating each account with their `id` (v3.x user ID) value as opposed to continuing to rely on the `legacy_id` field as a primary identifier.\n\nHere is an **example workflow** for how you can migrate users to their new identifiers:\n\n1.  Iterate through the `role` array on the v3.x user object\n2.  Looking at each node, match `legacy_id` value of each role against your existing accounts.\n3.  If the user matches an account in your system, associate it with the provided `id` (3.x user ID) value.\n\nAlternatively, please be sure to check out our [v3.0 Migration Tool](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360043514192?language=en_US#Request%20API%20V3%20Migration%20CSVs)!\n\nIf you must create separate accounts for each user type, developers can add complete matching by role by adding the `?role` parameter to the user endpoint, and using the respective role fields. Note: separate accounts will have one Clever ID for updates moving forward.\n\n  \n\n> ## 🤔\n> \n> How are Contacts handled in v3.x?\n> \n> Contacts were included in the v3.0 user object consolidation and can be retrieved by making a GET request to [https://api.clever.com/v3.0/users?role=contact](https://api.clever.com/v3.0/users?role=contact).\n> \n> However, a contact cannot be a multi-role user. This differs from the other user types in Clever, such as teachers, staff, and district admins. As an example, if the same person has a teacher and a contact role at a district, they will have two separate accounts: one for their teacher role, and one for their contact role. The will also have different Clever IDs.",
