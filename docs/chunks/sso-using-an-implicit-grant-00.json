  "content": "Use the OAuth 2.0 [implicit grant flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2) to obtain bearer tokens in client-side Javascript or on a native device without access to client secrets.\n\nIn our **traditional** SSO flow, Clever sends users to a redirect URI on your sever with a `code` parameter. After your server receives this, it initiates a request to Clever to exchange that `code` for a bearer token representing the user. Your application may have initiated this flow with a Log in with Clever button or Clever may have initiated thee flow using the Clever Portal or an Instant Login Link.\n\nThis token exchange flow is simplified further in Clever's **implicit grant flow**. Instead of receiving a `code` vaue that you must then exchange for a bearer token, Clever delivers the bearer token to your redirect URI as part of a URI fragment.\n\nWe still recommend implementing Clever's traditional SSO flow if you anticipate users signing in through Clever's launchpad or via other district-driven approaches. Some features districts rely on will not work with the Implicit Grant Flow exclusively. Additionally, district tokens cannot be negotiated with the implicit grant flow.\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> This feature is not generally available\n> \n> For security reasons, the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant flow is only available to applications that cannot use the authorization grant flow outlined in [Instant Login & the Identity API](/docs/identity-api). If you cannot use the authorization grant flow, please reach out to [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#167f786273716477627f79786556757a736073643875797b).\n\n## \n\nWho is this for?\n\n[](#who-is-this-for)\n\n-   Web applications authored in client-side Javascript or Flash\n-   Widely distributed open source applications\n-   Web browser extensions and plugins\n-   WordPress, Drupal, Moodle, or other platform extensions\n-   Native mobile applications\n-   Native desktop applications\n\n## \n\nRequirements\n\n[](#requirements)\n\n-   You need the **client ID** of the application you're developing against Clever with. Locate your client ID by signing in to your Clever developer account and navigating to your application configuration. This ID is used to identify your application to Clever.\n-   You must register a redirect URI as part of your application record that will be used for the implicit grant flow. This may be an additional redirect URI or the same redirect URI you already use. You'll be handling URL fragments specially in this flow and you may want to separate concerns with a unique URL path.\n\n## \n\nThe implicit grant flow, step by step\n\n[](#the-implicit-grant-flow-step-by-step)\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/95ee26b-clever-oauth-implicit-grant-flow.png \"clever-oauth-implicit-grant-flow.png\")\n\nLet's examine this flow in more detail with a hypothetical example.\n\nWe have an application called Flight School. Here are some vitals on how we're configured.\n\nField\n\nValue\n\nClient ID\n\n`anVpY2VqdWljZWp1aWNlCg`\n\nRedirect URIs\n\n`https://flightschool.edu/oauth`, `http://localhost/oauth`, `https://flightschool.edu/oauth/implicit`, `http://localhost/oauth/implicit`\n\nYour configuration will look something like this. You'll definitely be using a different Client ID, and your redirect URIs will be your own. Regardless, you can complete this implicit grant flow.\n\nI've decided to take my own advice and use a dedicated URI path which I'll use for the remainder of this example: `https://flightschool.edu/oauth/implicit`.\n\n## \n\nStep 1: Present a \"Log in with Clever\" button\n\n[](#step-1-present-a-log-in-with-clever-button)\n\nYou may recall Log in with Clever buttons from [Instant Login & the Identity API](/docs/identity-api#section-log-in-with-clever)\n\nIn this flow, we're going to build our button with the response\\_type parameter set to token. This will instruct Clever to handle subsequent steps with the implicit grant flow. We'll also provide the redirect URI we decided on, properly URL escaped.\n\n```\nhttps://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%flightschool.edu%2Foauth%2F/implicit&client_id=anVpY2VqdWljZWp1aWNlCg&state=fb37f982-925b\n```\n\nNotice we've included the `state` parameter - this is important! By randomly generating a nonce value and providing it here, Clever will send it back to your application in the next step. This allows you to validate that your application initiated this flow. We recommend using \"opaque\" values for state parameters — a human should not be able to understand what information is described in state. See [Keeping Instant Login Secure](/docs/il-security) for more information.\n\n## \n\nClever authorizes the user\n\n[](#clever-authorizes-the-user)\n\nThis step is identical to typical \"Log in with Clever\" usage. If the user is not yet signed in via Clever, they'll be prompted for their district-specific credentials before the next step. If they're already signed in, Clever will instantly send the user back to your `redirect_uri` in the next step.\n\n## \n\nClever sends the user to your redirect\\_uri along with a bearer token\n\n[](#clever-sends-the-user-to-your-redirect_uri-along-with-a-bearer-token)\n\nAfter authorization, the user will be sent to your specified `redirect_uri` with the user's bearer token attached to the URI fragment as an `access_token` field.\n\nContinuing our example, we might receive the end user at this variant of our redirect URI:\n\n```\nhttps://flightschool.edu/oauth/implicit#token_type=bearer&state=fb37f982-925b&access_token=ZWdnbWFuIGkgYW0gdGhlCg&scope=read%3Astudents%20read%3Ateachers%20read%3Auser_id\n```\n\nTo extract the bearer token from the request and validate the state parameter, we first must evaluate the URI fragment.\n\n### \n\nWhat's a URI fragment?\n\n[](#whats-a-uri-fragment)\n\nURI fragments appear as the final element of a URI and begin with a hash character (`#`). They are sometimes referred to a the hash component of a URL.\n\nConsider the following imaginary URL: `https://example.com/some/path?field0=value0#field1=value1&field2=value2`",
