  "content": "> ## 📣\n> \n> New: Clever Complete\n> \n> With Clever Complete, your application can now support any K–12 district, even those that aren’t using Clever. Clever now provides a partner-branded district experience, so you can deliver rostering, SSO, LMS integrations, and more for districts that don’t want to manage a separate Clever account. Sign up [here](https://www.clever.com/developer-signup) to learn more.\n\n  \n\n# \n\nClever Secure Sync\n\n[](#clever-secure-sync)\n\nClever Secure Sync lets you sync data from every SIS with one integration. Instead of building a separate connector for OneRoster files, PowerSchool, Aeries, Skyward, Infinite Campus, eSchoolPlus, and more, you can quickly provision accounts and use that time to improve your core product.\n\n## \n\nSecure Sync\n\n[](#secure-sync)\n\nSecure Sync allows you to:\n\n-   Access information about users and provision accounts in advance.\n-   Access roster information such as student-teacher associations and classroom data.\n\nClassroom-only applications have access to user information only when the user logs in through Instant Login (IL).\n\nNot sure if Secure Sync is right for you?

There are three major components to a solid Secure Sync integration:\n\n1.  **Onboarding Districts**: Identifying the district-app token and preparing to ingest data.\n2.  **Initial Sync**: Matching existing data and provisioning accounts for the first time.\n3.  **Ongoing Sync**: Handling changes to data on an ongoing basis, including semester and school-year rollover.\n\nWe'll go over best practices for each of these pieces in the next three pages.",
