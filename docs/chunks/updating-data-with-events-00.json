  "content": "Data retrieved from the Clever API serves as a \"snapshot\" of what currently exists in a district's student information system. However, sometimes it can be valuable to pull in the deltas, and avoid the overhead of pulling down all data. You can also use events to see how this data came to be in the state it's currently in via a \"timeline\" view. Clever's events endpoint provides a 30-day window that describes changes to a district's data.\n\n**Events are only available to Secure Sync customers.**\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Events from other API Versions\n> \n> Please note: Events for fields and objects that are introduced in **later** API versions will **not** appear in this version of the API. Please be sure to review the available events for your specific API version.\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> If you are using events, you should be able to perform an initial sync or resync directly from the Data API (students, teachers, etc.) The Events API is offered only as a convenience for keeping up with changes. Processing data from the events endpoints should be idempotent, meaning that processing the same event multiple times should result in no change of state.\n\n## \n\nEnabling events\n\n[](#enabling-events)\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Events opt-in changes\n> \n> Starting December 2022, events will be opt-in only. If you are not currently using events in production, you will need to enable events to use them moving forward.\n\nTo enable events, go to Settings > Integrations > Enable events. Once events are enabled, Clever will begin generating events for all connected districts.\n\n![2506](https://files.readme.io/9fc2f85-Screen_Shot_2022-11-10_at_1.36.03_PM.png \"Screen Shot 2022-11-10 at 1.36.03 PM.png\")\n\nIf you disable events, Clever will stop generating new events for changes in district data.\n\n## \n\nHow long are events stored?\n\n[](#how-long-are-events-stored)\n\n**Events are stored for a period of 30 days**. The event feed is sorted from older to newest, and after 30 days events are removed from our system. Events that are 31+ days old will be removed from the events timeline, i.e. the \"top\" of the events list.\n\n## \n\nAnatomy of an event\n\n[](#anatomy-of-an-event)\n\nEvent JSON data objects contains the following fields:\n\n`type`: Type of event. See Event Types for more detail.  \n`data`: Full JSON of object in clever that was created, updated, or deleted.  \n`id`: Clever ID of the event. Not to be confused with the Clever ID of the data object represented in the event  \n`created`: Timestamp that the event was created. This should be used for informational purposes\n\nEvents also contain the usual paging and links fields found in the Clever API.\n\n## \n\nEvent types\n\n[](#event-types)\n\n## \n\nCreated\n\n[](#created)\n\nusers.created events are generated when a new object is created in an SIS **or** when a district shares an object with your application. Notice in the example below that you can identify the user type based on the \"roles\" node.\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\"created\": \"2021-12-02T17:15:46.000Z\"\n\t\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\t\"object\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"created\": \"2020-11-10T17:07:23.909Z\"\n\t\t\t\t\"district\": \"58da8a43cc70ab00017a1a87\"\n\t\t\t\t\"email\": \"[email protected]\"\n\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"58da8c65d7dc0ca06800074b\"\n\t\t\t\t\"last_modified\": \"2021-12-02T17:05:51.925Z\"\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"first\": \"Helen\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"last\": \"Fisher\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"middle\": \"J\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\"roles\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"student\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\t\"id\": \"61a8ff42a2df9b130cf6509c\"\n\t\t\"type\": \"users.created\"\n\t}\n\t\"uri\": \"/v3.0/events/61a8ff42a2df9b130cf6509c\"\n}\n```\n\n## \n\nUpdated\n\n[](#updated)\n\nusers.updated events are generated when Clever sees a change on an object. To see which fields have changed, inspect the `previous_attributes` hash. Notice in the example below that you can identify the user type based on the \"roles\" node.  \nExample:\n\n```json\n\"data\": {\n\t\"created\": \"2021-11-14T17:06:55.000Z\"\n\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\"object\": {\n\t\t\t\"created\": \"2020-11-10T17:07:22.367Z\"\n\t\t\t\"district\": \"58da8a43cc70ab00017a1a87\"\n\t\t\t\"email\": \"[email protected]\"\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"58da8c63d7dc0ca068000447\"\n\t\t\t\"last_modified\": \"2021-11-11T17:05:58.926Z\"\n\t\t\t\"name\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"first\": \"Pedro\"\n\t\t\t\t\"last\": \"Bauch\"\n\t\t\t\t\"middle\": \"D\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\"roles\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"student\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"credentials\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"district_username\": \"pedrob07\"\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\"dob\": \"8/1/2000\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"enrollments\": []\n\t\t\t\t\t\"ext\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"gifted_status\": \"\"\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\"gender\": \"M\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"grade\": \"7\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"graduation_year\": \"\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hispanic_ethnicity\": \"N\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"location\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"address\": \"\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"city\": \"\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"state\": \"\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"zip\": \"10017\"\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\"race\": \"Black or African American\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"school\": \"58da8c58155b940248000008\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"schools\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"58da8c58155b940248000007\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"58da8c58155b940248000008\"\n\t\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t\t\t\"sis_id\": \"180999707\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"state_id\": \"399605649\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"student_number\": \"180999707\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\t\"previous_attributes\": {\n\t\t\t\"roles\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"student\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"ext\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"gifted_status\": \"Y\"\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\"id\": \"6191422ff93d5a03e33d2f7e\"\n\t\"type\": \"users.updated\"\n}\n\"uri\": \"/v3.0/events/6191422ff93d5a03e33d2f7e\"\n}\n```\n\n## \n\nDeleted\n\n[](#deleted)\n\nusers.deleted events are generated when Clever sees than an object was removed from an SIS **or** when a district unshares an object with your application.
