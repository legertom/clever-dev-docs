For example, if a district is sharing by student, you may have sections where only some of the students enrolled are accessible to you. Attempting to look up information for any of the unshared students will result in a 404 error.\n\nIf you run into this error:\n\n1.  Check to see if there is a record with that ID in your database.\n2.  If that record exists, archive it.\n3.  If no record with that Clever ID exists, ignore the error and move on to the next record.\n\nReceiving a 404 error on an object **should not** block a district's sync. Your sync should continue to process the remainder of the district's data.\n\n### \n\nChecking Logs and Data Warnings\n\n[](#checking-logs-and-data-warnings)\n\n#### \n\nData Warnings\n\n[](#data-warnings)\n\nYour data model may have additional requirements beyond what Clever requires. For example, some applications require that all students have a unique email address. If your application has any specific requirements in order for records to be processed, we'll help you set data warnings to alert districts that your sync won't process records not meeting these requirements. If you've indicated to your Account Manager or Clever Support that your application has specific data requirements, we can add these as either data warnings or data requirements to your application. In your Clever Dashboard, you can then click the \"Data Warnings\" link to see whether there is data in the district that does not meet your requirements.\n\n#### \n\nLogging\n\n[](#logging)\n\nYou should build detailed logging into your Clever sync - if a record cannot be processed, or tokens cannot be required, you should be able to find when the failure occurred and why.",
