Regardless of how the user is initiating SSO, they will need to authenticate into Clever at some point.\n\n  \n\nAs seen in the screenshot below, districts can set up different identity providers (IDPs) to authenticate their users into Clever. As it relates to your SSO integration, **you will not need to concern yourself with how users are logging into Clever**. Just know that this is a requisite step in order to start the SSO process with Clever.\n\n  \n\n![1444](https://files.readme.io/9ff1dd2-Clever___Log_in.png \"Clever___Log_in.png\")\n\nScreenshot of a Clever login page with multiple identity providers.\n\n  \n\n## \n\nSSO from the Clever Portal\n\n[](#sso-from-the-clever-portal)\n\n  \n\n![2874](https://files.readme.io/15e1da8065959a347d92c9c73c02828c74ede85a36e1c4e7a269dc11adf34771-Screenshot_2025-06-06_at_11.17.13_AM.png \"Clever___Homeroom.png\")\n\nScreenshot of the Clever Portal from a teacher's perspective.\n\n  \n\nMany districts use the Clever Portal as the primary launch point for their applications. Once you are certified and connected to a district, your integration will be represented by an icon on the Clever Portal. When a user clicks this icon, they will be redirected to your **primary redirect URI** with an authorization code appended.\n\n  \n\nTake a look at this [Demo Experience](https://clever.com/in/demo) to see the user experience within Clever. Demo credentials can be found by clicking into the credentials fields.\n\n  \n\n**The steps below summarize how users will access your SSO integration by logging into their Clever Portal**\n\n  \n\n1.  User accesses their district's Clever login page.\n2.  User chooses the correct IDP as defined by their district (i.e. \"Log in with Google\", \"Log in with Active Directory\").\n3.  User is redirected to their identity provider.\n4.  User enters their identity provider credentials.\n5.  On successful login, the user is navigated to their Clever Portal and clicks on an application icon to kick off the login process into the application.\n\n  \n\n## \n\nSSO Using Instant Login Links\n\n[](#sso-using-instant-login-links)\n\n  \n\nSome districts prefer not to use the Clever Portal, but still want to use Clever SSO to allow teachers, students, and staff to access their applications. To support this, Clever built [Instant Login links](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/205546348). These are links that can be embedded anywhere and are used to log a district's users into a specific application through SSO. An example Instant Login link is shown below:\n\n  \n\n```text\nhttps://clever.com/oauth/instant-login?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&district_id=THE_DISTRICT_ID\n```\n\n  \n\n**The steps below summarize how users will access your SSO integration by clicking an Instant Login Link**\n\n  \n\n1.  User clicks on an Instant Login Link - these are usually embedded in their district's portal or homepage or saved as a bookmark in their browser\n2.  User is taken to the Clever login page\n    -   This step, and steps 3 and 4, are skipped if the user is already logged in to Clever\n3.  User clicks on the 'Log In with {IDP}' button - again, this step is skipped for districts that are using Clever-managed Passwords\n4.  User enters their credentials\n5.  Clever kicks off the login process into the application.\n\n  \n\n## \n\nSSO Using a \"Log In With Clever\" Button\n\n[](#sso-using-a-log-in-with-clever-button)\n\n  \n\nSome end-users are used to logging in directly from an application's site rather than using a portal. To allow users to authenticate using Clever SSO, you can embed a \"Log in with Clever\" (LIWC) button on your website. Here are some examples:\n\n![842](https://files.readme.io/d995bec-Access_Read_Ahead_-_Read_Ahead__Highlight_Ideas_with_Motion.png \"Access_Read_Ahead_-_Read_Ahead__Highlight_Ideas_with_Motion.png\")\n\nExample LIWC button using a Clever button asset\n\n![884](https://files.readme.io/81ab9eb-Login_-_Kahoot_.png \"Login_-_Kahoot_.png\")\n\nExample LIWC button using a Clever icon asset\n\n  \n\nA LIWC button is a link to `https://clever.com/oauth/authorize` with added parameters that define which application Clever should send the user to. The bare minimum of information that should be provided is:\n\n  \n\n-   The type of `response` anticipated (in almost every case, we expect a `code` to be returned)\n-   Your application's `client_id`\n-   Your application's `redirect_uri`\n\n  \n\nHere's a sample LIWC URL:\n\n  \n\n```text\nhttps://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\n```\n\n  \n\nNotice that this link does not include a `district_id` parameter. This is because a link on your application's website should be accessible by users from _any district_. A typical user's district will be stored contextually within their browser. As such, if they were to click your LIWC button, they should be navigated directly to their district login page.\n\n  \n\nHowever, if the user's browser does not have the district context stored, the user is going to see the **Clever school picker**.\n\n  \n\n![1268](https://files.readme.io/bc8ef8d-Clever___Select_your_School.png \"Clever___Select_your_School.png\")\n\nScreenshot of the Clever school picker\n\n  \n\nEnd-users should be able to find their district's login page by typing in their school name.\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> When Testing Logins with Sandbox Data\n> \n> Please note that you will not be able to search sandbox districts and schools by name. You will instead need to use the sandbox district ID.\n\n  ",
