  "content": "While LMS Connect provides a consistent integration framework across LMSs, certain fields within assignments and submissions may behave differently depending on the platform. This documentation highlights those LMS-specific differences—such as how due dates, section mappings, or submission statuses are interpreted—so you can anticipate any edge cases or platform-specific behaviors when building or troubleshooting.\n\n## \n\nCanvas\n\n[](#canvas)\n\n### \n\nAssignments\n\n[](#assignments)\n\nBehavior\n\nDescription\n\nNotes\n\n“Submitting” in UI shows “nothing”/is blank\n\nWhen the assignment was created, the **submission\\_types** field was likely left blank. Confirm with a GET call to /v3.1/sections/{id}/assignments/{id}.\n\nMake a PATCH call to /v3.1/sections/{id}/assignments/{id} and update the **submission\\_types** field to resolve.\n\nUnsupported Fields\n\n**start\\_date**, **term\\_id**\n\n**start\\_date** - In Canvas, the **start\\_date** is set to be the same as **display\\_date**. Use **display\\_date** instead.\n\nUpdating assignment **state**\n\nWhen creating or updating an assignment, the **state** value is ignored.  \n  \nE.g., POSTing to /v3.1/sections/{id}/assignments with **state** in the request body, or PATCHing to /v3.1/sections/{id}/assignments/{id} with state in the request body.\n\nCanvas does not support updating the **state** field on an **assignment**. The field is ignored if provided in the request body when creating or updating an assignment.  \n  \nThe assignment **state** value is automatically updated to specific values based on certain actions. For example, when a teacher un-publishes an assignment in Canvas, the **state** value will be updated to **draft** automatically on the API.  \n  \nThe default **state** value after creating an assignment is **open**.\n\n  \n\n### \n\nSubmissions\n\n[](#submissions)\n\nBehavior\n\nDescription\n\nNotes\n\nMissing “Max Attempts” value in Canvas\n\nWhen the assignment was created, the max\\_attempts field was set to “-1”. Confirm with a GET call to /v3.1/sections/{id}/assignments/{id}.  \n  \nResolution: Update the **max\\_attempts** for the assignment to a positive integer value.\n\nIf **max\\_attempts** is not included in the POST request body when creating the assignment, **max\\_attempts** is defaulted to “-1”\n\nUnsupported Fields\n\n**grade**, **grader\\_id**, **state**, **override\\_due\\_date**\n\n\\- **grade** - Canvas only supports **grade\\_points** or **pass\\_fail**. Grade will be ignored when updating a submission if one of these values is not used.  \n  \n\\- **grader\\_id** - Canvas only supports this field when making grade comments on a submission. If included in calls without **grade\\_comment**, Canvas will ignore the field. See _Updating grade comments on Submissions_ below for more information.  \n  \n\\- **state** - Canvas does not support updating the state field on a submission. The field is ignored if provided in the request body when updating a submission.  \n  \n\\- **override\\_due\\_date** - Canvas does not support updating the **override\\_due\\_date** field on a submission. The field is ignored if provided in the request body when updating a submission.\n\nUpdating Submission **state**\n\n**state** will be automatically updated to **submitted** when an attachment is included in the request body when updating submissions.\n\nCanvas does not support updating the **state** field for a submission via API. The field is ignored if included in the request body when PATCH updating a submission.  \n  \nCanvas does not support the **returned** or **reclaimed** field at this time.\n\nEmpty string values ignored for **grade\\_comment** field\n\nWhen updating a submission, if a **grade\\_comment** value has been previously provided, then an empty string is passed in a new PATCH call, Canvas ignores the empty string.\n\nThis appears to be Canvas-specific. Testing with other LMS’s yielded different results:  \n  \n\\- **Schoology**: updated the **grade\\_comment** value to be an empty string  \n\\- **Google Classroom**: Ignores the **grade\\_comment** field\n\nUpdating submissions on draft assignments (state: draft) is not supported\n\nWhen updating a submission for an assignment that has a state value of **draft**, the Clever API returns the following message:  \n  \n\"code\": \"UNSUPPORTED\\_OPERATION”  \n  \n\"Canvas does not allow updating submissions on unpublished (draft) assignments.\"\n\nAll assignments must be published in order to update submissions.  \n  \nIf an assignment has a **state** value of **draft**, only the teacher can change this value to **open** by publishing the assignment via the Canvas UI.\n\nUpdating grade comments on Submissions\n\nIn order to add grade comments to a student's submission, you'll need to include the following fields in your PATCH request body:  \n  \n\\- **grade**  \n\\- **grade\\_comment**  \n\\- **grader\\_id**\n\nThe default user for grade comments will appear as \"Monica Simo\" if no **grader\\_id** value is specified. You should always include a **grader\\_id** in your calls to add grade comments.  \n  \nAdditionally, if the **grade\\_comment** field is blank in the request, Canvas will ignore the field.\n\n* * *\n\n## \n\nGoogle Classroom\n\n[](#google-classroom)\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> _Requires districts to have the GCRI integration with Clever_\n\n### \n\nAssignments\n\n[](#assignments-1)\n\nBehavior\n\nDescription\n\nNotes\n\nCannot update assignment attachments\n\nGoogle Classroom does not allow updating assignment attachments.
