The teacher’s account is provisioned immediately, and the teacher is logged in to a free or freemium experience with their section and student data populated. The app is added to the [Clever Portal](https://clever.com/products/sso) for the teacher and their shared students, so those students can also log in to the app.\n\nThere are two entry points into your application that facilitate the teacher sign up process:\n\n1.  Teachers who find you through the Clever Library and click “Install\".\n2.  Teachers who click “Sign Up with Clever” button on your website’s teacher signup page.\n\n## \n\nWhat data is shared?\n\n[](#what-data-is-shared)\n\nIf the teacher consents, your application will be authorized to access the following limited set of data fields for class information **_only belonging to that teacher_**. You'll use this data to automatically create user accounts and set up classes to make the signup experience as smooth and seamless as possible.\n\n**Teacher object data**\n\n-   Clever ID - globally unique and stable ID for each user, created by Clever\n-   Name (first, middle, last)\n-   Email\n\n**Teacher’s shared sections, as primary or co-teacher**\n\n-   Clever ID\n-   Name\n-   Section\\_number\n-   Teachers\n-   Students\n-   Subject (normalized to a set of possible values)\\*\n-   Grade (if available from the SIS)\\*\n\n**Student object data in those sections**\n\n-   Clever ID (this is not sid\\_id or student\\_number; it’s a GUID generated by Clever)\n-   Name (first name, last initial)\n-   Grade (if available from the SIS)\\*\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Normalized Fields\n> \n> Clever normalizes certain fields to a defined set of possible values:\n> \n> **Subject:** \\[\"english/language arts\",\"math\",\"science\",\"social studies\",\"language\",\"homeroom/advisory\", \"interventions/online learning\",\"technology and engineering\",\"PE and health\",\"arts and music\",\"other\",\"\"\\]\n> \n> **Grade:** \\[\"1\", … ,\"13\", \"PreKindergarten\", \"TransitionalKindergarten\", \"Kindergarten\", \"InfantToddler\", \"Preschool\", \"PostGraduate\", \"Ungraded\", \"Other\", \"\"\\]\n\nFor more details on each field, and to see how the Library “teacher-shared” set of data fields compares with full rostering “district-shared” fields, please refer to [Clever's Data Schema](https://clever.com/schema).\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Why are school info, district info, and full student name not provided for Library users?\n> \n> We don't share district ID, school ID, and full student name in order to limit the data shared to what most districts consider a \"non-PII\" signup for students. This has been instrumental in getting districts excited about the Clever Library and promoting it to their teachers as a good way to sign up for new applications. About half of our current integrated apps do require school and/or district information, and in those cases, build in as part of the onboarding flow when a teacher first logs in this way a prompt for the teacher to pick their school.\n\n## \n\nNext Steps\n\n[](#next-steps)\n\n## \n\n1\\. Check out a demo\n\n[](#1-check-out-a-demo)\n\nTest drive the experience yourself by logging into [https://clever.com/in/demo](https://clever.com/in/demo) using a demo teacher account: skelly/clever, and clicking on “Library” at the top-right of the screen.\n\n> ## ❗️\n> \n> Note: The skelly/clever account is meant for you to demo the product, not for you to test your integration!\n> \n> To find test users for your integration, visit [Testing Your Integration (Library)](/docs/classroom-testing#testing-with-multiple-users)\n\n## \n\n2\\. Set up your development app in Clever\n\n[](#2-set-up-your-development-app-in-clever)\n\nSee the [Getting Started](/docs/classroom-getting-started) page for more details.\n\n## \n\n3\\. Build and test your integration\n\n[](#3-build-and-test-your-integration)\n\nUsing this guide, with additional support from Clever’s SSO developer documentation, build your OAuth 2.0 integration in a dev or staging environment. Before you get started, please review the integration requirements outlined in [Certification Requirements](/docs/il-certification) and follow [Classroom Rostering](/docs/classroom-rostering) for details.\n\nTo test your integration, we’ve created a sandbox district that is intentionally not connected to your application in order to simulate a Clever teacher sign-up into your app. See [Testing Your Integration](/docs/classroom-testing) for details.\n\nAdditionally, the Clever Dashboard has a Library Integration Guide that can be used to help your build within product. You can access this within the Library tab of your Dashboard and this will help walk you through the steps needed to build and test your integration.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/09b02c2-Library_Integration_Guide.png \"Library Integration Guide.png\")\n\n## \n\n4\\. Upload marketing collateral\n\n[](#4-upload-marketing-collateral)\n\nFor us to best showcase your product in the Library, please upload the following assets by completing the **Marketing Collateral wizard** in the new Library tab of your dashboard. You can do this prior to submitting for certification.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/2806a08-librarytab1.png \"librarytab1.png\")\n\nHere is a preview of what we ask for:",
