  "content": "Google Classroom is the only LMS that supports updating the **state** value for a submission. If the field isn’t provided when updating the submission, the Clever API will return the most recent value.  \n  \nFor example, if **state** is set to **created**, and an updated value isn’t provided in the update submission request, Clever will return the value **created**.  \n  \nAuto-update actions:  \nSubmission **state** will automatically update to **submitted** when the attachments array is included in the PATCH request body.\n\ndue\\_date not required\n\n**due\\_date** is not a required field in Google Classroom– a teacher may remove it.\n\n* * *\n\n## \n\nSchoology\n\n[](#schoology)\n\n### \n\nAssignments\n\n[](#assignments-2)\n\nBehavior\n\nDescription\n\nNotes\n\n**Term\\_id** required\n\nIn Schoology, **term\\_id** is required for assignments.\n\n**term\\_id** in this context refers to the Clever generated term ID.\n\nOnly **text** attachment type supported for writes\n\nIn Schoology, only the text attachment type is supported for writes (link is supported for reads).\n\n**Start\\_date** field not supported by Schoology\n\nError message when request includes **start\\_date** field:  \n  \n\"code\": \"FIELD\\_IGNORED\",  \n\"message\": \"The 'start\\_date' field is not supported by Schoology, and will be ignored.\"\n\n  \n\n### \n\nSubmissions\n\n[](#submissions-2)\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> _Requires LTI SSO set up by the district and a successful LTI session by the end user._\n> \n> Please refer to this page for more information: [Clever LMS Connect - Submitting Schoology Submissions](/docs/submitting-schoology-submissions)\n\nBehavior\n\nDescription\n\nNotes\n\nUpdating submission **state**\n\nWhen updating a submission via PATCH /v3.1/sections/{id}/assignments/{id}/submissions/{student\\_id}, the **state** value is ignored, if included in the request body for the call.  \n  \n**state** will be automatically updated to **submitted** when an attachment is included in the request body.  \n  \n**state** will be automatically updated to **returned** when the **grade\\_points** field is included in the request body.\n\nSchoology does not support updating the **state** field for a submission via API. The field is ignored if included in the request body when PATCH updating a submission.  \n  \nThe **reclaimed** value is not supported by Schoology.\n\nUnsupported Fields\n\n**state (see above)** , **grader\\_id**, **grade**, **flags**, **extra\\_attempts**, **override\\_due\\_date**\n\n**grade** field defaults to the **grade\\_points** value\n\n**grade** defaults to the **grade\\_points** value rather than using the string value provided in the PATCH update submission request.\n\ne.g., PATCH request body has **\"grade\" : \"B\"** and **“grade\\_points” : “85”**, but when making a GET call to view the submission, **grade** returns as 85, which was the **grade\\_points** value in the PATCH request.\n\nOnly **text** attachment type supported for writes\n\nIn Schoology, only the text attachment type is supported for writes (link is supported for reads).\n\nAssignment submissions not able to be PATCHed due to **grading category**\n\nSubmission will return 200 OK, but submission will not show up in Schoology.\n\nSchoology has a concept of **grading\\_category** (shown as “**Category**”) that needs to be manually assigned by the teacher in the UI.  \n  \nThis is found in **Schoology**, under **Course > Assignment > gear icon > Edit > Category**.",
