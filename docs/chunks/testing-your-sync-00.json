You can test your sync against three data sets: a default sandbox district, a larger Clever USD, and a Certification ISD, or create your own custom sandbox district.\n\n## \n\nTesting with a Default Sandbox District\n\n[](#testing-with-a-default-sandbox-district)\n\nWhen you sign up for a dev app, a sandbox district is automatically created and linked to your dev app. The naming convention is {dev app name} Sandbox, and you can find it listed as a district in your dashboard on the \"Home\" tab.\n\nThe default sandbox district has:\n\n-   5 schools\n-   33 sections\n-   41 users\n    -   7 teachers\n    -   14 students\n    -   14 student contacts\n    -   6 school admins\n\nEach dev app is given its own sandbox dataset, so the instance is unique to your app.\n\nYou can download the default district CSVs to test other users [here](https://assets.clever.com/devdocs/default_sandbox_data.zip).\n\n## \n\nTesting with Clever USD\n\n[](#testing-with-clever-usd)\n\nYou can also download CSVs for a larger dataset to populate your default sandbox district [here](https://assets.clever.com/devdocs/cleverusd.zip). This district includes:\n\n-   239 schools\n-   25,843 or more sections\n-   460,000 or more enrollments\n-   65,503 or more users\n    -   8,412 or more teachers\n    -   56,635 or more students\n    -   6 staff\n\n## \n\nTesting with Certification ISD\n\n[](#testing-with-certification-isd)\n\nAnother option is to connect to a centralized dataset that:\n\n1.  Contains known edge cases and \"unclean data\" you can use to verify that your integration can handle these correctly. This allows you to test the worst of the worst district data. To facilitate the generation of these edge cases, this dataset **automatically rotates between 3 days of data every 3 days**.\n    \n    The full list of edge cases and the users that fulfill each one can be found in this spreadsheet: [Certification ISD Edge Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETku1FnlFN1fNADSpziASnnJIHJMFaUmPWdZzQ06xko/pubhtml).\n    \n    The raw data can be found here: [Certification ISD](https://assets.clever.com/devdocs/CertificationISD.zip).\n    \n2.  Allows you to test [Events](/reference/events) syncs. If you are looking to test events, you can leverage the automatic rotating nature of this sandbox to process the event stream.\n    \n    If you'd like to do this, please reach out to [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1970776d7c7e6b786d7076776a597a757c6f7c6b377a7674) with the name of your dev app and a request to connect to the Certification ISD sandbox district.\n    \n    Note that, unlike the auto-created sandboxes, this sandbox is centrally managed by Clever and therefore read-only; you won't be able to make any changes to this sandbox.\n    \n\n## \n\nCreating Your Own Custom Sandbox District\n\n[](#creating-your-own-custom-sandbox-district)\n\nTo perform testing with a new custom sandbox where you upload your own data, check out our [guide to creating your own custom sandbox district](/docs/custom-sandbox-districts).",
