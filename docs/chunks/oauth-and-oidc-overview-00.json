  "content": "## \n\nPrerequisites\n\n[](#prerequisites)\n\nRead [Clever SSO Overview](/docs/sso-overview).\n\n## \n\nOverview\n\n[](#overview)\n\n  \n\nClever uses OAuth 2.0 and the related OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard to manage user authorization and authentication.\n\n  \n\nThe OAuth 2.0 specification (see below) defines several methods, or flows, for providing tokens. These tokens can be used to access an API or, in the case of OIDC, may directly provide information about a user's identity. Clever uses the **authorization code grant type**. If you are unable to use the authorization code grant type, please reach out to [Clever Support](https://support.clever.com).\n\n  \n\n-   [OAuth 2.0 Specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749)\n-   [OpenID Connect (OIDC) Specification](https://openid.net/connect/)\n\n  \n\n## \n\nDefinitions\n\n[](#definitions)\n\n  \n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> **Bolded terms** found in this section of the documentation are defined below.\n\n  \n\n-   **Access Token**\n    -   Credentials used to access user data. The token is an opaque string representing authorization that has been issued to the client.\n    -   Do not confuse a user-level access token with the district-level token. The user-level token only authorizes access to that specific user’s data while a district token grants access to data across the district. To learn more about the district token, see [District-App Tokens](/docs/api-overview#district-app-tokens).\n-   **Authorization Code Grant Type**\n    -   This is one of the grant types associated with the OAuth Authorization Grant Flow. It requires an authorization server to grant an authorization code after the resource owner is authenticated and has authorized the client.\n-   **Authorization Grant**\n    -   A credential representing the resource owner’s authorization. The end-user is saying, “Yes, this application is authorized to access my data. Please give them an access token.”\n-   **Clever ID**\n    -   Globally unique identifier assigned to each data object in Clever. Denoted as `id` in the API response, this field should be used to identify resource owners in an SSO exchange.\n-   **Client**\n    -   An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization. Please note that the term “client” does not imply any implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices).\n-   **Discovery Endpoint**\n    -   Provides a client with configuration details about the OpenID Connect Authorization Server. The client makes an HTTP GET call to the discovery endpoint: /. well-known/openid-configuration. A discovery document is returned containing the OpenID Connect implementation details.\n-   **Identity Token**\n    -   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that conform to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) specification. They are composed of a set of key-value pairs called claims. Unlike access tokens, which are opaque objects that cannot be inspected by the application, ID tokens are meant to be inspected/decoded and used by the application.\n-   **Primary Redirect URI**\n    -   The first redirect URI in your list of redirect URIs. When a redirect URI is not specified for an SSO request, the primary redirect URI will be used.\n-   **Redirect URI**\n    -   The location where the authorization server sends the user once the app has been successfully authorized and granted an authorization code.\n    -   Clever will always use the first Redirect URI listed in your App Dashboard Settings for Clever Portal-initiated logins.\n-   **Userinfo Endpoint**\n    -   An OAuth 2.0 protected resource of the Connect2id server where client applications can retrieve consented claims, or assertions, about the logged in end-user. The claims are typically packaged in a JSON object where the sub member denotes the subject (end-user) identifier, in this case, a Clever ID.\n\n  \n\n## \n\nOAuth/OIDC Data Access\n\n[](#oauthoidc-data-access)\n\n  \n\nWhile Clever's Data API has endpoints for roster information (and more), **access tokens** acquired through the OAuth flow only have access to:\n\n  \n\n-   [/me](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/developer-collections/request/elnxugm/me?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=11463743&ctx=documentation) - provides the token `type` (always `user` for SSO tokens), Clever user ID, and district ID\n-   [/districts/{id}](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/developer-collections/request/qd2bpk4/districts-id?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=11463743&ctx=documentation) (where `id` is the district Clever ID)\n-   [/users/{id}](https://www.postman.com/clever-pe/developer-collections/request/gbicgr1/users-id?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=11463743&ctx=documentation) (where `id` is the user Clever ID)\n\n  \n\n**Identity token**s provide the following claims:\n\n-   _user\\_id_: the Clever user ID for API versions prior to v3.0\n-   _user\\_type_: student, teacher, staff, or district admin\n-   _district_: the user's Clever district ID\n-   _multi\\_role\\_user\\_id_: the Clever user ID for API v3.0 and beyond\n-   _email_: the user's email, if available\n-   _email\\_verified_: false by default (reach out to [Clever Support](https://support.clever.com) if you need this claim to be 'true')\n-   _given\\_name_: the user's first name\n-   _family\\_name_: the user's last name\n\n  \n\nThe **Identity tokens** also provide some standard metadata:\n\n-   _iss_: always set to \"[https://clever.com](https://clever.com)\"\n-   _sub_: the multi-role Clever user ID (used for API v3.0 and beyond)\n-   _aud_: the application Client ID\n-   _iat_: the time the token was created\n-   _exp_: one hour from the token issued time\n-   _nonce_: Used to prevent CSRF attacks. The nonce should match the parameter included in the original /authorize request to Clever. If it does not match, your application should reject the token. _This claim will not show up if a nonce parameter is not provided (e.g. if the IDP initiated the request)_\n\n  ",
