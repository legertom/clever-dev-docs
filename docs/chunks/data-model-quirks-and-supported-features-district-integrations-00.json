  "content": "# \n\nHandling Edge Cases in Clever Data\n\n[](#handling-edge-cases-in-clever-data)\n\nData in Clever can experience a number of edge cases listed below. Although these are not typical cases, it's a good idea to be prepared for these to occur. If your integration cannot handle any of these cases, please reach out to [Clever Support](https://support.clever.com) to create [Data Warnings](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/202043083-What-are-data-warnings-and-data-errors-) to avoid any errors in your sync.\n\n## \n\nUsers (New to v3.0)\n\n[](#users-new-to-v30)\n\n-   Users are merged across employees of a district (District Admins, Staff, Teachers) only. This means that it's possible for two users to have the same email address if the email address is also associated with a Student or Contact.\n-   If a district changes email addresses for a record, this can cause a User record to get a new Clever ID or for a merged User to be split into multiple users.\n-   The full contact name will be stored in the `last_name` field of the user object.\n\n## \n\nGeneral\n\n[](#general)\n\n-   The district is the top-level object in Clever; even if a single school has signed up for an account, there will still technically be a district object for their account.\n-   Clever's strings have no maximum length (if you must specify a field length, we recommend 255 chars as a safe limit).\n-   Clever's strings support all UTF-8 characters.\n-   There isn't a normalization of email format (emails may be missing the '@' sign).\n\n## \n\nTerms\n\n[](#terms)\n\n-   Most districts do not send actual terms to Clever, so most are constructed from information on the section object. As such, districts must sync at least one of `term name`, `term start date`, or `term end date` in order for a term to be created.\n-   If all of the sections associated with a term are deleted or the term information changes, the term will be deleted (and potentially recreated).\n-   As of 1/31/18, term IDs are not stable, so if a term is deleted and recreated, it will have a new Clever ID.\n\n## \n\nCourses\n\n[](#courses)\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Changes for Back to School 2023\n> \n> Beginning in January 2023, Clever is changing how we process course data to make courses more stable. If districts provide a `course_number` for a course, we will use it as the key ID for the course. This means that:\n> \n> -   If there are multiple courses with the same `course_number`, we will merge them into one course.\n> -   If changes are made to `course_name` but `course_number` remains stable, we will update the course name instead of deleting and recreating courses.\n> \n> These changes are currently available on a per-district basis at request. If you have the need for merged courses based on course number, reach out to [Clever Support](https://support.clever.com)\n\n-   Most districts do not send actual courses to Clever, so most are constructed from information on the section object. As such, districts must sync at least `course_name` in order for a course to be created.\n-   If all of the sections associated with a course are deleted or the course information changes, the course will be deleted (and a new one may be created).\n-   As of 1/31/18, course IDs are not stable, so if a course is deleted and recreated, it will have a new Clever ID.\n\n## \n\nSections\n\n[](#sections)\n\n-   Sections are the only way student and teacher associations are described in Clever. If a student or teacher is not enrolled in any sections, they will not be associated with any students/teachers.\n-   Sections must have at least one student.\n-   Sections are associated with a school, but the associated students and teachers in the section can be enrolled in any school in the district.\n-   Sections can have only one primary teacher, and up to 9 additional co-teachers.\n-   There is no limit to how many students may be enrolled in a section.\n-   Section names are not guaranteed to be unique.\n-   Section grade might not match all students' grades.\n\n## \n\nStudents\n\n[](#students)\n\n-   Students can be enrolled in multiple sections.\n-   Students might not be enrolled in any sections.\n-   Students can be enrolled in sections in multiple schools.\n-   Students can be enrolled in sections that contain other students and teachers that are not associated with their primary school.\n\n## \n\nTeachers\n\n[](#teachers)\n\n-   Teachers can teach multiple sections.\n-   Teachers might not teach any sections.\n-   Teachers can teach sections in multiple schools.\n-   Teachers can teach classes that contain other students and teachers that are not associated with their primary school.\n\n## \n\nSchool Administrators\n\n[](#school-administrators)\n\n-   School administrators can be in multiple schools.\n-   School administrators do not have a primary school association (there is only a `schools` field, not a `school` field at the `/school_admins` endpoint).\n\n## \n\nContacts\n\n[](#contacts)\n\n-   Not a guaranteed field from Clever.\n-   Contact type is not consistent (type varies from SIS to SIS).\n-   Information might be limited to one contact per student.\n-   The full contact name will be stored in the `last_name` field of the user object.",
