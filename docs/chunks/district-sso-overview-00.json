  "content": "Clever District Single Sign-on (SSO) allows districts to set up single-sign-on access to any supported application with a single Clever identity and login. By supporting SSO, a Clever user can sign in to your application with the credentials they already know, no matter which identity provider their district is using.\n\nIn this section, we'll go through how users can log in to your application, the mechanics behind it, and how to set up SSO for your application.\n\n## \n\nInitiating Logins / User Experience\n\n[](#initiating-logins--user-experience)\n\nThere are three ways a user can log in to your application using SSO:\n\n-   [The Clever Portal](/docs/identity-api#logging-in-from-the-clever-portal)\n-   Instant Login Links\n-   Log in with Clever buttons\n\nYour integration should be able to handle logins from any of these sources.\n\n## \n\nLogging in from the Clever Portal\n\n[](#logging-in-from-the-clever-portal)\n\nMany districts use the Clever Portal as the primary launch point into their applications.\n\n1.  User accesses Clever Portal (ex: [https://clever.com/in/demo](https://clever.com/in/demo))\n2.  User clicks on the \"Log in with {IDP}\" button (note in the example above, this does not appear as the district's IDP is Clever-managed Passwords\n\n-   This step is also skipped if the user is already logged in to Clever\n\n3.  User is redirected to their Identity Provider\n4.  User enters in their credentials\n5.  On successful login, user sees their portal and clicks on an application icon to kick off the login process into the application.\n\n## \n\nInstant Login Links\n\n[](#instant-login-links)\n\nSome districts prefer not to use the Clever Portal, but still want to use SSO to access their applications. To support this, Clever built [Instant Login links](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/205546348) which are links that can be embedded anywhere and are used to log a district's users in to a specific application through Instant Login. An example Instant Login link is: `https://clever.com/oauth/instant-login?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&district_id=THE_DISTRICT_ID`.\n\n1.  User clicks on an Instant Login link - these are usually embedded in their district's portal or homepage or saved as a bookmark in their browser\n2.  User is taken to the Clever login page\n\n-   This step, and steps 3 and 4 are skipped if the user is already logged in to Clever\n\n3.  User clicks on the 'Log In with {IDP}' button - again, this step is skipped for districts that are using Clever-managed Passwords\n4.  User enters in their credentials\n5.  Clever kicks off the login process into the application.\n\n## \n\nLog In With Clever\n\n[](#log-in-with-clever)\n\nUsers will also often attempt to log in from an application's site directly, not using any portal. To allow users to use Clever SSO to authenticate, you can embed a \"Log in with Clever\" (LIWC) button on your website.\n\nA LIWC button is a link to `https://clever.com/oauth/authorize` with added parameters that define which application Clever should send the user to. The bare minimum of information that should be provided is:\n\n-   Your application's `client_id`\n-   Your application's `redirect_uri`\n-   The type of `response` anticipated (in almost every case, we expect a `code` to be returned)\n\nThat's it. Here's a sample LIWC URL:\n\n```\nhttps://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\n```\n\nClicking this link will actually take you to Clever's 'school picker,' which helps students find their district login page by searching for their school name. To reach a sandbox account, you'll actually search by the district ID. If you're using the example link above, you can go ahead and enter `53ee4b8a44abc88c1c00119b` in the search box to reach the sandbox district's login page.\n\nIf your application has district-specific login pages, you can also add `district_id`as a parameter on the URL to skip the school picker and go straight to the district's login page. Example:\n\n```\nhttps://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&district_id=53ee4b8a44abc88c1c00119b\n```\n\n### \n\nLIWC Button Assets\n\n[](#liwc-button-assets)\n\n![207](https://files.readme.io/0e6a756-LogInWithClever.png \"LogInWithClever.png\") ![414](https://files.readme.io/efb3f5d-LogInWithClever2x.png \"LogInWithClever@2x.png\") ![207](https://files.readme.io/9dab929-LogInWithClever--Secondary.png \"LogInWithClever--Secondary.png\") ![414](https://files.readme.io/31c4e09-LogInWithClever--Secondary2x.png \"LogInWithClever--Secondary@2x.png\")\n\n## \n\nSSO: OAuth2.0 and OIDC\n\n[](#sso-oauth20-and-oidc)\n\nClever uses OAuth 2.0 and the related OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard to manage user authorization and authentication. If you are already familiar with these standards, you can skip to [Setting Up SSO in Clever](#section-setting-up-sso-in-clever)\n\n[The OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) defines several methods, or flows, for providing tokens. These tokens can be used to access an API or, in the case of OIDC, may directly provide information about a user's identity. Clever uses the Authorization Grant flow (in some cases the Implicit Grant flow, documented [here](/docs/il-implicit-grant), may also be allowed).\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Get Set Up for OIDC\n> \n> To use OpenID Connect with Clever and receive identity tokens, you must first contact [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dbb2b5afbebca9baafb2b4b5a89bb8b7beadbea9f5b8b4b6) to have your application appropriately configured.\n\nOnce a user initiates a login, the Authorization Grant flow looks like this:",
