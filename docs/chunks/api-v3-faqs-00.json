Will users have new IDs in Clever v3.0?\n\n[](#1-will-users-have-new-ids-in-clever-v30)\n\n-   Yes. With v3.0, we introduced the user ID field, which now represents a user’s specific identifier, regardless of their role.\n\n### \n\n2\\. What data differences are there between 1.1 and 3.0 (e.g. is there another gender type?)\n\n[](#2-what-data-differences-are-there-between-11-and-30-eg-is-there-another-gender-type)\n\n-   The biggest difference between the two versions is the introduction of a single “users” object instead of separating each user type into individual objects. These users are individually queryable by adding a role type parameter e.g., `/users?role=teacher`.

What are the criteria for creating a user with multiple roles? Does the district SIS have to support multiple roles, or are multiple users in the SIS merged into one Clever user?\n\n[](#3-what-are-the-criteria-for-creating-a-user-with-multiple-roles-does-the-district-sis-have-to-support-multiple-roles-or-are-multiple-users-in-the-sis-merged-into-one-clever-user)\n\n-   In order for a user to have multiple roles in Clever, they must first have either a teacher or staff (school admin) account. Those with District Admin accounts can also have a staff or teacher account in Clever.\n\n### \n\n4\\. Does the district SIS have to support multiple roles or are multiple users in the SIS merged into one Clever user?\n\n[](#4-does-the-district-sis-have-to-support-multiple-roles-or-are-multiple-users-in-the-sis-merged-into-one-clever-user)\n\n-   The district simply provides data according to the user role. For example, in a district that uses SFTP to sync with Clever, all teachers in the district must be listed in the `teachers.csv` file. Any user populated in this file will be assigned a teacher account in Clever. If this same user is listed in the `staff.csv` file with the same email address, they will also have a staff account created for them and it will be associated with the same user ID.\n\n### \n\n5\\. What is the upper limit to the number of roles per user, if any?\n\n[](#5-what-is-the-upper-limit-to-the-number-of-roles-per-user-if-any)\n\n-   A user can have the roles of teacher, staff, and district admin, but cannot be more than one of any type. It’s important to note that students are limited to that user type.",
