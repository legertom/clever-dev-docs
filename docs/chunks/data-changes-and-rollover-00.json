If a match is found, merge the records; if no match is found, create a new record.\n2.  **Deactivate Obsolete Records**:\n    \n    -   For records in your database with a Clever ID not present in Clever's data (or if accessing the data returns a 404 error), deactivate these records to maintain data integrity.\n\n## \n\nConstructing \"Diff\" Files\n\n[](#constructing-diff-files)\n\nInstead of completely replacing your database with Clever's dataset, you may choose to create a file that outlines the necessary changes. This approach allows for more controlled updates. Methods to achieve this include:\n\n-   **Events-Based Sync**: Utilize Clever's [Events API](/docs/events-api) to receive real-time data changes. This method is efficient and recommended for applications requiring scalable synchronization.\n    \n-   **Data Comparison**: Compare your existing dataset with Clever's data to generate a file that captures the differences. This method involves analyzing both datasets and identifying discrepancies to create an accurate diff file.\n    \n\n## \n\nProtecting Against Unintentional Changes\n\n[](#protecting-against-unintentional-changes)\n\nTo prevent accidental data modifications or deletions:\n\n-   **Monitor Significant Changes**: If a sync operation results in a substantial number of data changes or deletions, pause the sync and review the changes with the district administrator to confirm their intent.\n    \n-   **Utilize Clever's Hold System**: Clever's hold system prevents large-scale changes from propagating until approved by a district administrator. However, this system does not cover changes due to sharing modifications.\n    \n-   **Set Deletion Thresholds**: Be aware of Clever's thresholds for data changes. During the school year, if more than 10% of any record type is deleted, the sync is paused until reviewed. This threshold is relaxed during school year rollover periods when updates are more frequent.\n    \n\n## \n\nSemester and School Year Rollover\n\n[](#semester-and-school-year-rollover)\n\nEducational institutions may handle term transitions differently:\n\n-   **Term Reuse vs. New Term Creation**:\n    \n    -   **Term Reuse**: Some Student Information Systems (SIS) reuse sections from term to term, updating enrollments, teachers, and terms as needed.\n    -   **New Term Creation**: Other districts may create entirely new sections with new Clever IDs at the start of a new term.\n-   **Application Handling**:\n    \n    -   Ensure your application can manage both scenarios by archiving old terms and reactivating them if necessary.\n    -   Review your rollover processes to determine if adjustments are needed to accommodate Clever's integration.",
