  "content": "1.  Clever redirects the user to your application's redirect URI with a code appended\n2.  Your application POSTs the code back to Clever's token endpoint with the appropriate credentials\n3.  Clever responds with an access token, and potentially an identity token, for the user\n4.  Your application can use the access token at`https://api.clever.com/v3.0/me` to get the user's Clever ID. Alternatively your application can decode an identity token to get basic user information via claims\n5.  Your application can use access tokens against Clever's Data API to acquire any additional information you need\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> While Clever's Data API has endpoints for roster information (and more), access tokens acquired through the OAuth flow only have access to:\n> \n> -   /me - provides the token `type` (always `user` for SSO tokens), Clever user ID, and district ID\n> -   /districts/{district}\n> -   /`users`/{id}\n> \n> Identity tokens provide the following claims:\n> \n> -   _user\\_id_: the Clever user ID for API versions prior to v3.0\n> -   _user\\_type_: student, teacher, school\\_admin, or district\\_admin\n> -   _district\\_id_: the user's Clever district ID\n> -   _multi\\_role\\_user\\_id_: the Clever user ID for API v3.0 and beyond\n> -   _email_: the user's email, if available\n> -   _email\\_verified_:\n> -   _given\\_name_: the user's first name\n> -   _family\\_name_: the user's last name\n> \n> The Identity tokens also provide some standard metadata:\n> \n> -   _iss_: always set to \"[https://clever.com\"](https://clever.com%22)\n> -   _sub_: the multi-role Clever user ID (used for API v3.0 and beyond)\n> -   _aud_: the application Client ID\n> -   _iat_: the time the token was created\n> -   _exp_: one hour from the token issued time\n> \n> [Secure Sync](/docs/district-getting-started) allows you to access the entirety of the Data API, our matchmaking tools, and more.\n\n## \n\nSetting Up SSO in Clever\n\n[](#setting-up-sso-in-clever)\n\n## \n\nRequirements\n\n[](#requirements)\n\n-   [A development application](/docs/getting-started)\n-   A sandbox district - when you sign up for your development application, one is automatically created for you. You can also [create your own custom sandbox district using these instructions.](/docs/custom-sandbox-districts)\n-   OIDC applications will need to contact [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a33342e3f3d283b2e333534291a39363f2c3f2874393537) to have the application configured for sending identity tokens\n\n## \n\nEnabling SSO\n\n[](#enabling-sso)\n\nAt the bottom of [your application's settings page](https://apps.clever.com/applications), you'll see your app's OAuth Settings.\n\n![1373](https://files.readme.io/f2b97d8-Clever___Application_Settings-2.png \"Clever___Application_Settings-2.png\")\n\nHere, you'll **define your Redirect URIs** - the URL to which Clever will redirect your users and add a code at the start of the Authorization Grant flow. You can have more than one redirect URI, but please note that Clever will direct users to the first one in the list by default.\n\n## \n\nRedirect URI Requirements:\n\n[](#redirect-uri-requirements)\n\n-   The redirect URI should point to a location where you expect to receive users' login attempts\n-   Development applications can use non-HTTPS URIs, but please note that all production applications are required to use HTTPS URIs\n\nYou'll also want to **enable SSO for users** - use the dropdown to select which user types your application will support. Your application will only allow logins from users of the selected types. If not added:\n\n-   Users of the unselected type(s) will see a Clever error message if they attempt to log in through an Instant Login Link or Log In With Clever button.\n-   Students & Teachers: the application will not appear in their Clever Portal\n-   School & District Admins: the application will appear in their Clever Portal, but will have a flag indicating SSO is not supported for their user type. Clicking on the application icon will direct the user to the application's website\n\n## \n\nAuthenticating Users\n\n[](#authenticating-users)\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> Using Third-party Authentication Services\n> \n> If you are using a third-party authentication service, the steps below can be automatically performed after setting a few standard configuration fields. Visit [this section](#working-with-third-party-authentication-services) for more details.\n\n## \n\nAcquiring a Code\n\n[](#acquiring-a-code)\n\nWhen a user attempts to log in to your application, Clever will redirect them to your application. If the login is Clever-initiated (Portal or Instant Login Link), this will be your primary redirect URI. If the login is from a LIWC button, you may specify a different redirect\\_uri.\n\nWhen a user is redirected to your redirect URI, you'll find the `code` parameter attached with a variable length string as its value:\n\n`https://primary.redirect?code=code`\n\nAt this point, you won't know who the user is or what type of user they are, but grab the code - you won't need to persist it for too long, but you will need it for the next step.\n\n### \n\nRedirect URI Parameters\n\n[](#redirect-uri-parameters)\n\nHere are the parameters you can expect to see Clever add when redirecting users to your primary or specified redirect URI:\n\nParameter\n\nGuaranteed\n\nValue\n\n`code`\n\nYes\n\nCode generated by Clever\n\n`scope`\n\nYes\n\nScope assigned to your application by Clever\n\n`state`\n\nOnly if provided via LIWC link\n\nState value provided by your LIWC link\n\n## \n\nExchanging the Code for a Token\n\n[](#exchanging-the-code-for-a-token)\n\n> ## 📘\n> \n> It may take your application a few seconds to complete these next steps of the token exchange sequence. We recommend rendering a user interface as quickly as possible while you take care of these server-side steps in the background.",
