Amongst other fields, it includes a due date as well as a potential score.\n-   A **submission** is a specific student’s attempt at completing the assignment.\n\n> ## 🚧\n> \n> Save your assignment IDs!\n> \n> There is currently no way for you to call the API for a list of your existing assignment IDs. Once an assignment has been created and an **assignment ID** has been generated, you will need to save each assignment ID you generate in your own database so that you can make adjustments to the assignments later. Failure to do this will result in an inability to access previously created assignments in the API. If this happens, please reach out to [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d2bbbca6b7b5a0b3a6bbbdbca192b1beb7a4b7a0fcb1bdbf)\n\n### \n\nAssignment\n\n[](#assignment)\n\nClick to expand/collapse the assignment object description.
